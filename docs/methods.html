        <p style="background-color:olive; padding:1.5em">Our methods in completing the markup mainly include breaking the script up into three chunks, each marking up one part, and then recomiling (while abiding by our schema that was outlined previously and has been getting tweaked along the way as needed). Additionally, we'll most likely end up using XSLT of some kind to output the script in a clean, readable way on the site, including scene links, etc.</p>
