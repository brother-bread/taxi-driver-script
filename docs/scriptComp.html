            <h1>Script vs. Movie Comparison</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>Given that this was the <i>shooting</i> script, the difference between the page and
                the screen isn’t a night-and-day comparison. It’s largely the same movie, but after
                going through the script, we found there to be at least a few notable and
                interesting changes made by Scorsese. In general, there are a fair amount of minor
                dialogue tweaks, a fair amount of sentences trimmed here and there. Nothing to
                change the course of a scene, and mostly the same, but the spoken word is a little
                looser than what’s on the page. Though notably (except for a few cut passages),
                Travis’ diary entries do remain <i>almost exactly</i> the same. </p>
            <p>The only things “missing” (in the movie compared to the script) are a couple random
                interactions with more hostile passengers, a conversation between cabbies at the
                office, and a more fleshed-out scene of Travis going to the record store to buy
                Betsy’s album. Also, the Tom character does not have such a direct relationship with
                Palantine as he does in the script (as he’s replaced by nameless assistants in the
                film outside of his scenes with Betsy). Surprisingly, the aspects that the
                    <i>movie</i> created and the script doesn’t have are some of its most iconic.
                For example, Travis’ signature mohawk was a screen invention (as it’s just a full
                shave on the page); and, probably the <i>most</i> famous, Travis’ paranoid mirror
                rant (“You talkin’ to me?”) is also an entirely directorial creation.</p>
            <p>Overall, as mentioned, there wasn’t any crazy transformation from the script to the
                screen - mostly what can be described as “trimmings” for the sake of pace. The core
                of the character, plot, and tone are as clear to read as they are to see. But it’s
                also interesting to see what other kinds of changes were made and speculate as to
                why.</p>

                <strong>Other Misc. Comparison Notes:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Much of the same atmosphere/visuals described in the screenplay are present
                    on-screen</li>
                <li>Tom and Betsy chatter is cut down</li>
                <li>Travis doesn’t tell Betsy his dead passenger story in the movie</li>
                <li>“I forgot to get the Coca-Cola” line not present in movie</li>
                <li>Many shots/camera moves described by Schrader are followed through with
                    precision</li>
                <li>Occasional efforts to keep Travis’ mentality slightly less overt and
                    on-the-nose</li>
                <li>Script doesn't have the final “sting” moment right at the end to hint at Travis’
                    future</li>
            </ul>
