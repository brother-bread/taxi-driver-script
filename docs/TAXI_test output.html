            bullshitter, and Travis' intense reply stops him dead in his

            Well, he should clean up this city
            here. It's full of filth and scum.
            Scum and filth. It's like an open
            sewer. I can hardly take it. Some
            days I go out and smell it then I
            get headaches that just stay and
            never go away. We need a President
            that would clean up this whole mess.
            Flush it out.<span class="desc"> (thinks)</span></div>

            I know what you mean, Travis, and
            it's not going to be easy. We're
            going to have to make some radical

            goodbye to TRAVIS.</div>

         <div class="narr">EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING
            TRAVIS, dressed to the teeth, walks brightly down the
            sidewalk. His face is frehsly shaved, his hair combed, his
            tie straightened.
            He pauses in a store window to check his appearance.
            Under his arm he carries the gift-wrapped Kristofferson record
            album.
            OUTSIDE PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
            BETSY, smartly dressed, waves goodbye to another CAMPAIGN
            WORKER and walks out the door to greet him.
            A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS and BETSY are walking down
            Broadway toward Times Square. BETSY does not let their bodies
            touch as they walk although TRAVIS contemplates edging closer
            to her.
            Betsy has opened the package and is admiring the record -
            or, rather, Travis' sentiment behind giving it.
            Travis looks around himself with pride: This is a moment in
            his life - one of the few.</div>
         <div class="narr">Betsy notices that the seal on the record has not been broken.</div>
