<openQuote>"The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief
that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon,
is the central and inevitable fact of human existence."
<person>THOMAS WOLFE</person>,
    "God's Lonely Man"</openQuote>
<intro><narr><char who="trav">TRAVIS BICKLE</char>, age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner. On
the surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a
quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from
nowhere, lighting up his whole face. But behind that smile,
around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the
ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness
and loneliness. He seems to have wandered in from a land
where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants
seldom speak. The head moves, the expression changes, but
the eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is now drifting in and out of the New York City night
life, a dark shadow among darker shadows. Not noticed, no
reason to be noticed, <char who="trav">Travis</char> is one with his surroundings.
He wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt
and a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, "King
Kong Company 1968-70".
He has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex,
lonely sex, but sex nonetheless. He is a raw male force,
driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. Then one looks
closer and sees the evitable. The clock sprig cannot be wound
continually tighter. As the earth moves toward the sun, Travis
Bickle moves toward violence.</narr></intro>

CREDITS</scene>

<scene>
<narr>CREDITS appear over scenes from <loc ext="true">MANHATTAN NIGHTLIFE</loc>. The
snow has melted, it is spring.
A rainy, slick, wet miserable night in Manhattan's theatre
district.
Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well-dressed
pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. The
high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows
are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the
poor and common is also falling on them.
The unremitting SOUNDS of HONKING and SHOUTING play against
the dull pitter-patter of rain. The glare of yellow, red and
green lights reflects off the pavements and autos.
"When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" -
so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular
night's activity. Only the taxis seem to rise above the
situation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and
traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please.
Further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so
glittering. The rain also falls on the street bums and aged
poor. Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners,
hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. And the taxis service
them too.
All through the CREDITS the exterior sounds are muted, as if
coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner.
The listener is at a safe but privileged distance.
After examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife, <shot close="true">CAMERA
begins to CLOSE IN on one particular taxi, and it is assumed
that this taxi is being driven by <char who="trav">TRAVIS BICKLE</char></shot>.</narr>

<char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> is sitting at plain table writing. He wears shirt,

can ash tray.
<shot close="true">CLOSE UP of notebook</shot>. It is a plain lined dimestore notebook
and the words <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> is writing with a stubby pencil are
those he is saying. The columns are straight, disciplined.
Some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink. The handwriting
is jagged. <shot panning="true">CAMERA continues to PAN, examining <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char>' apartment</shot>. It is
unusual, to say the least:
A ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall. The floor
is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets
maps and pornography. The pornography is of the sort that
looks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos
of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and
clothesline. There is no furniture other than the rickety
chair and table. A beat-up portable TV rests on an upright
melon crate. The red silk mass in another corner looks like
a Vietnamese flag. Indecipherable words, figures, numbers
are scribbled on the plain plaster walls. Ragged black wires
dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung.</narr>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS (V.O.)
They're all animals anyway. All the
animals come out at night: Whores,

<char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> stands next to the cab, straightens his back, and
tucks the bottle of pills into his jacket pocket. He lowers
his head, looks into back seat, opens rear door and bends
inside.
He shakes a cigarette out of his pack of camels and lights
it.
SLIGHT TIMECUT: <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> books it at garage office. Old, rotting

<d who="bets">BETSY

<d who="trav">TRAVIS
I shot the meter off, for one thing.

<narr><shot pov="true">Lengthy POV SHOT from <char who="trav">Travis'</char> vantage point behind the wheel</shot>.
We see the city as <char who="trav">Travis</char> sees it. The front windshield is a
little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right
screen. The intercom crackles with STATIC and MESSAGES.
The light turns green; we take off with a start. A short
first gear - quick shift - a long second gear. The cab eases
to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares.
Our eyes scan the long lines of <char who="side">PEDESTRIANS</char>. The regular -
bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies -
they mean nothing now. They only blend into the sidewalks
and lighted storefronts.
Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the
curb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head?
In the next block there are perhaps three, four fares - quick
gas-up through this yellow light - brake sharply - check the
action. The first: Tourist, nickel tipper - let the next guy
pick them up. Let the second go also, the third - there's a
live fare. Middle-aged <char who="side">LOCAL WOMAN</char>: Short fare to the East
Side, good tip.
We pull to the curb, waiting for her to get in. It is a long
wait - a Black <char who="side">STREET WALKER</char> crosses in front of the cab. We
focus on (as <char who="trav">Travis</char> would) a <char who="side">YOUNG COUPLE</char> embracing in the
distance.
As we travel, we hear <char who="trav">Travis'</char> random thoughts about selecting
fares and tips:</narr>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS (V.O.)
You work at night, you get an
instinct. You can smell them. The
big tippers, the stiffs, the trouble
makers. Quarter is good tip for
Manhattan. Queens is better, Brooklyn
is best. go for the guys with
suitcases. The rich are the worst
tippers, hooks are lousy. Spooks
are okay, but they don't live at
Park Ave after all.</d>
<narr>The meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. A
quick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says softly,
"192 East 89". We take off with another jolt. Cross back up
9th Ave, then cut through the park.
We're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we string
together?</narr>
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
<narr>Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but quickly steps back
again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be a $1.40 fare.
Now through the park and we're almost there. Check the numbers -
134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40.
Check back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quarters
and a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35.
The tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We take
off again with a jolt.
This is <char who="trav">Travis'</char> world: Dark side streets, garish glaring
main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen

<char who="trav">Travis</char> makes an awkward gesture to escort <char who="bets">Betsy</char> into the

<char who="trav">Travis</char>. She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the
turnstile. She thinks to herself: "What the Hell. What can

anyway, and - like all women, no matter how intelligent -
she's been raised not to offend her date. A perverse logic
which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like

ON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is
speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in
a happy marriage. Subtitles translate her words. Then,

FIVE scrumptious <char who="side">TEENYBOPPERS</char> are literally hanging on his

He hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices
withdrawing it. He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length,
tightening his forearm muscles.
He has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his
inner forearm, whereby the Colt .25 can rest hidden behind
the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated,
sending the .25 flying down the gliders into his palm. He
has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism and
now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden.
He straps an Army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit
in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly.
He now tries on various combinations of shirts, sweater and
jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide
all the handguns he wishes to carry. Finally, wearing two
western shirts, a sweater and jacket, he manages to obscure
the location of all three guns, although he resembles a hunter
bundled up against the Arctic winter.
He sits at the table dum-dumming the .44 bullets -- cutting

A rally platform in a supermarket parking lot somewhere in

A <char who="side">CROWD</char> of about 500 persons mills about, waiting for the

The <char who="side">CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN</char>, with their distinctive

On the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of <char who="side">LOCAL POLITICOS</char>

As <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> rolls astride the GIRLS, he notices the familiar

look toward the SHADOWED FIGURE, smile, acknowledge some
unheard comment, and continue on.
<char who="iris">IRIS</char> looks back uneasily at <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char>' taxi and continues on.
On the corner stand TWO well-to-do <char who="side">COLLEGE STUDENTS</char>, somewhat
out of place in this environment, but making every attempt

The GIRLS spot the <char who="side">COLLEGE STUDENTS</char> and walk over to them.
They exchange some small talk and walk off together. There
is little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick-up.
<char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to
continue following the GIRLS and their <char who="side">COLLEGIATE JOHNS</char>.
This is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy.
As <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> slows down to make the turn, he notices <char who="side">ANOTHER
HIPPIE HOOKER</char> who had been watching him watching <char who="iris">IRIS</char> and
her <char who="side">GIRLFRIEND</char>. She walks over to the taxi, loans in the
