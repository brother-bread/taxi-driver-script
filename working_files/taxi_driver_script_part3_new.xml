Now is the time to stand up against
such foolishness, propaganda and
demagoguery. Now is the time for
one man to stand up and accept his
neighbor, for one man to give in
order that all might receive. Is
unity and love of common good such a
lost thing?</d>

(reading)
Dear Father and Mother, June is the
month, I remember, which brings not
only your wedding anniversary, but
also Father's Day and Mother's
birthday. I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact dates, but I hope this
card will take care of all of them.
I'm sorry I again can not send you
my address like I promised to last
year, but the sensitive nature of my
work for the Army demands utmost
secrecy. I know you will understand.
I am healthy and well and making
lots of money. I have been going
with a girl for several months and I
know you would be proud if you could
see her. Her name is Betsy, but I
can tell you no more than that.</d>

with a four-color embossed cover. The design could only be
described as ur-kitsch. A cartoon Mr. and Mrs. All-America

CUT TO:
<narr>NIGHT on the LOWER EAST SIDE. <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> sits parked in the
dark shadows of a side street. The lone wolf waits.
<char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> watches the SLUM GODDESSES as they work the section
of the street reserved for hippie hookers.</narr>
<desc shot="pov"><char who="trav">TRAVIS</char>' P.O.V.: SOME OF THE YOUNG STREET GIRLS ARE ARROGANT,
almost aggressive, others are more insecure and inexperienced.
A BLACK MAN charges down the sidewalk across the street from
<char who="trav">TRAVIS</char>. He walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only at
the sidewalk in front of him. Out of his mouth comes a
continuous stream of invective: "That-cock-sucking-crazy-nogood-asshole-bitch-when-I-get-my-fucking-fingers-on-hernigger-tits-I'm-gonna-ring-em-and-shit-up-her-ass..." and so
on. He is Out of Control. Nobody seems to notice or care.</desc>
<narr><char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stakeout.
Finally, <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> spies the object of his search: <char who="iris">IRIS</char> walks
down the sidewalk with her GIRLFRIEND. <char who="iris">IRIS</char> wears her large
blue sunglasses.</narr>
<narr><char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), opens
the door and exits from the cab.</narr>
<narr>Flipping up the collar of his Army jacket, <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> slouches
over and walks toward <char who="iris">IRIS</char>. He sort of sidles up next to
her and walks beside her: <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> always looks most suspicious

they hate it. So I figure the best

First uniformed POLICE OFFICER rushes in room, drawn gun in
hand. Other POLICEMEN can be heard running up the stairs.
<char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> looks helplessly up at the OFFICER. He forms his
bloody hand into a pistol, raises it to his forehead and,
his voice croaking in pain, makes the sound of a pistol
discharging.</narr>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS
Pgghew! Pgghew!</d>
<narr>Out of breath fellow <char who="side">OFFICERS</char> join the first <char who="side">POLICEMAN</char>.
They survey the room.
<char who="trav">TRAVIS</char>' head slumps against the sofa.
<char who="iris">IRIS</char> is huddled in the corner, shaking.

-- from <char who="iris">IRIS</char> shaking against the blood-spattered wall -- to

with half a head, a bloody stump for one
hand and a knife sticking out the other

-- to puddles of blood and a lonely .44 Magnum lying on the
hallway carpet.
Down the blood-specked stairs on which lies a nickel- plated
.38 Smith and Wesson Special
-- to the foot of the stairs where <char who="side">SPORT</char>'s body is hunched
over a pool of blood and a small .32 lies near his hand

CUT TO:
<desc shot="tracking">SLOW TRACKING SHOT across INT. APARTMENT. Room appears pretty
much the same, although there is a new portable TV and an
inexpensive easy chair.
VISUAL: TRACK begins at table and works across the room to
the mattress.
WE SEE THESE ITEMS:
-- On the table rests the diary, closed. A desk calendar
stands on the table: it is October.
-- Across the wall where the <char who="side">Palantine</char> clippings once hung

CONTINUED:
there are now a series of new newspaper clippings. Right to
left, they read:
1. The first is a full back page from the N.Y. Daily News.
Headline reads: "CABBIE BATTLES GANGSTERS." There are large
photos of police standing in <char who="iris">IRIS</char>' room after the slaughter,
and a picture of <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char>' cabbie mug shot.
2. Underneath there is a more discreet clipping without photo
from the N.Y. Times. Two-column headline reads:
"Cabbie Shootout, Three Dead."
3. A follow-up story from the News. Two-column photo shows
plain middle-aged couple sitting in middle-class living room.
Two-column headline reads: "Parents Express Shock, Gratitude."
4. A two-column Daily News story without photo. Headline
reads: "Taxi-Driver Hero to Recover."
5. A one-column two-paragraph News story stuck on an obscure
page. Headline reads: "Cabbie Returns to Job."
-- At the end of the clippings, a letter is tacked to the
wall. It is a simple letter hand-written on plain white
paper. The handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear
neat and orderly. We recognize that it is the same letter
that is being read in voice over.
-- When we finally arrive at the mattress, we find it is
barren. A pillow and blanket (new purchases) are folded at
the head of the mattress.</desc>
<narr>AUDIO: THROUGHOUT THE TRACK, we hear the voice of a middleaged uneducated man reading in voice over.
It is the voice of <char who="iris">IRIS</char>' FATHER and he is reading a letter
he sent to <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char>, and which <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> has tacked to his wall.</narr>
<d who="side">IRIS' FATHER (V.O.)
Dear Mr. Bickle, I can't say how
happy Mrs. Steensma and I were to
hear that you are well and
recuperating. We tried to visit you
at the hospital when we were in New
York to pick up <char who="iris">IRIS</char>, but you were
still in a coma. There is no way we
can repay you for returning our <char who="iris">IRIS</char>
to us. We thought we had lost her,
but now our lives are full again.</d>

<d who="iris">IRIS' FATHER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Needless to say, you are something
of a hero around this household.
I'm sure you want to know about <char who="iris">IRIS</char>.
She is back in school and working
hard. The transition has been very
hard for her, as you can well imagine,
but we have taken steps to see she
never has cause to run away again.
In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you from
the bottom of our hearts.
Unfortunately, we cannot afford to
come to New York again to thank you
in person, or we surely would. But
if you should ever come to Pittsburgh,
you would find yourself a most welcome
guest in our home. Our deepest
thanks, Burt and Ivy Steensma</d>
