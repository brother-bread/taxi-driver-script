<openQuote>"The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief
that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon,
is the central and inevitable fact of human existence."
<person>THOMAS WOLFE</person>,
    "God's Lonely Man"</openQuote>
<intro><char who="trav">TRAVIS BICKLE</char>, age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner. On
the surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a
quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from
nowhere, lighting up his whole face. But behind that smile,
around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the
ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness
and loneliness. He seems to have wandered in from a land
where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants
seldom speak. The head moves, the expression changes, but
the eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is now drifting in and out of the New York City night
life, a dark shadow among darker shadows. Not noticed, no
reason to be noticed, <char who="trav">Travis</char> is one with his surroundings.
He wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt
and a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, "King
Kong Company 1968-70".
He has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex,
lonely sex, but sex nonetheless. He is a raw male force,
driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. Then one looks
closer and sees the evitable. The clock sprig cannot be wound
continually tighter. As the earth moves toward the sun, Travis
Bickle moves toward violence.</intro>
<scene num="1">FILM OPENS on <loc ext="true">EXT. of MANHATTAN CAB GARAGE</loc>. Weather-beaten
sign above driveway reads, "Taxi Enter Here". Yellow cabs
scuttle in and out. It is WINTER, snow is piled on the
curbs, the wind is howling.
INSIDE GARAGE are parked row upon row of multi-colored taxis.
Echoing SOUNDS of cabs idling, cabbies talking. Steamy breath
and exhaust fill the air.

SOUND of office busywork: shuffling, typing, arguing.
<loc int="true">PERSONAL OFFICE</loc> is a cluttered disarray. Sheets with heading
"Marvis, B &amp; W, Acme" and so forth are tacked to crumbling
plaster wall: It is March. Desk is cluttered with forms,
reports and an old upright Royal typewriter.
Dishelved middle-aged New Yorker looks up from the desk. We
CUT IN to ongoing conversation between the middle-aged
PERSONNEL OFFICER and a YOUNG MAN standing in front on his
desk.
The young man is <char who="trav">TRAVIS BICKLE</char>. He wears his jeans, boots
and Army jacket. He takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette.
The PERSONNEL OFFICER is beat and exhausted: he arrives at
work exhausted. TRAVIS is something else again. His intense
steely gaze is enough to jar even the PERSONNEL OFFICER out
of his workaday boredom.

TRAVIS
I ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid

PERSONNEL OFFICER
We don't need any misfits around
here, son.
A thin smile cracks almost indiscernibly across TRAVIS' lips.
TRAVIS
You kiddin? Who else would hack
through South Bronx or Harlem at
night?
PERSONNEL OFFICER
You want to work uptown nights?
TRAVIS
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know
I can't be choosy.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
(thinks a moment)
How's your driving record?
TRAVIS
Clean. Real clean.
(pause, thin smile)
As clean as my conscience.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Listen, son, you gonna get smart,
you can leave right now.
TRAVIS

Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.

(looks up at Travis)
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway.
There's always opening on one fleet

various pink, yellow

Fill out these forms and give them

your phone number. You gotta phone?
TRAVIS
No.

Well then check back tomorrow.
TRAVIS
Yes, Sir.

CREDITS</scene>
<scene num ="2">
5.
CREDITS appear over scenes from MANHATTAN NIGHTLIFE. The
snow has melted, it is spring.
A rainy, slick, wet miserable night in Manhattan's theatre
district.
Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well-dressed
pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. The
high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows
are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the
poor and common is also falling on them.
The unremitting SOUNDS of HONKING and SHOUTING play against
the dull pitter-patter of rain. The glare of yellow, red and
green lights reflects off the pavements and autos.
"When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" -
so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular
night's activity. Only the taxis seem to rise above the
situation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and
traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please.
Further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so
glittering. The rain also falls on the street bums and aged
poor. Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners,
hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. And the taxis service
them too.
All through the CREDITS the exterior sounds are muted, as if
coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner.
The listener is at a safe but privileged distance.
After examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife, CAMERA
begins to CLOSE IN on one particular taxi, and it is assumed
that this taxi is being driven by <char>TRAVIS BICKLE</char>.
END CREDITS</scene>
<scene num="3">CUT TO:
<char who="trav">Travis'</char>s yellow taxi pulls in foreground. On left rear door
are lettered the words "Dependable Taxi Service".
We are somewhere on the upper fifties on Fifth Ave. The rain
has not let up.
An ELDERLY WOMAN climbs in the right rear door, crushing her
umbrella. <char who="trav">Travis</char> waits a moment, then pulls away from the
curb with a start.
(CONTINUED)
6.
CONTINUED:
Later, we see <char who="trav">Travis'</char> taxi speeding down the rain-slicked
avenue. The action is periodically accompanied by Travis'
narration. He is reading from a haphazard personal diary.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
(monotone)
April 10, 1972. Thank God for the
rain which has helped wash the garbage
and trash off the sidewalks.
TRAVIS' POV of sleazy Midtown side street: Bums, Hookers,
Junkies.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I'm working a single now, which means
stretch-shifts, six to six, sometimes
six to eight in the a.m., six days a
week.
A MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT hails <char who="trav">Travis</char> to the curb.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
It's a hustle, but it keeps me busy.
I can take in three to three-fifty a week, more with skims.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT, now seated in back seat, speaks up:
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
(urgent)
Is Kennedy operating, cabbie? Is it
grounded?
On seat next to TRAVIS is half-eaten cheeseburger and order
of french fries. He puts his cigarette down and gulps as he
answers:
TRAVIS
Why should it be grounded?
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
Listen - I mean I just saw the needle
of the Empire State Building.
You can't see it for the fog!
TRAVIS
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
The Empire State in fog means
something, don't it? Do you know,
or don't you? What is your number,
cabbie?
(CONTINUED)
7.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
Have you tried the telephone?
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
(hostile, impatient)
There isn't time for that. In other
words, you don't know.
TRAVIS
No.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
Well, you should know, damn it, or
who else would know? Pull over right
here.
(points out window)
Why don't you stick your goddamn
head out of the goddamn window once
in a while and find out about the
goddamn fog!
TRAVIS pulls to the curb. The BUSINESS MAN stuffs a dollar
bill into the pay drawer and jumps out of the cab. He turns
to hail another taxi.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
Taxi! Taxi!
<char who="trav">Travis</char> writes up his trip card and drives away.
It is LATER THAT NIGHT. The rain has turned to drizzle.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> drives trough another section of Manhattan.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I work the whole city, up, down,
don't make no difference to me -
does to some.
STREETSIDE: TRAVIS' P.O.V. Black PROSTITUTE wearing white
vinyl boots, leopard-skin mini-skirt and blond wig hails
taxi. On her arm hangs half-drunk seedy EXECUTIVE TYPE.
TRAVIS pulls over.
PROSTITUTE and JOHN climb into back seat. TRAVIS checks out
the action in rear view mirror.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Some won't take spooks - Hell, don't
make no difference tom me.
TRAVIS' taxi drives through Central Park.
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
GRUNTS, GROANS coming from back seat. HOOKER and JOHN going
at it in back seat. He's having a hard time and she's probably
trying to get him to come off manually.
JOHN (O.S.)
Oh baby, baby.
PROSTITUTE (O.S.)
(forceful)
Come on.
TRAVIS stares blankly ahead.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS' APARTMENT. CAMERA PANS SILENTLY across INT. room,
indicating this is not a new scene.
TRAVIS is sitting at plain table writing. He wears shirt,
jeans, boots. An unfiltered cigarette rests in a bent coffee
can ash tray.
CLOSE UP of notebook. It is a plain lined dimestore notebook
and the words TRAVIS is writing with a stubby pencil are
those he is saying. The columns are straight, disciplined.
Some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink. The handwriting
is jagged.
CAMERA continues to PAN, examining TRAVIS' apartment. It is
unusual, to say the least:
A ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall. The floor
is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets
maps and pornography. The pornography is of the sort that
looks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos
of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and
clothesline. There is no furniture other than the rickety
chair and table. A beat-up portable TV rests on an upright
melon crate. The red silk mass in another corner looks like
a Vietnamese flag. Indecipherable words, figures, numbers
are scribbled on the plain plaster walls. Ragged black wires
dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
They're all animals anyway. All the
animals come out at night: Whores,
skunk pussies, buggers, queens,
fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal.
(a beat)
Someday a real rain will come and
wash all this scum off the streets.
(CONTINUED)</scene>
<scene num="4">9.
CONTINUED:
It's EARLY MORNING: 6 a.m. The air is clean and fresh and
the streets nearly deserted.
EXT. of TAXI GARAGE. TRAVIS' taxi pulls into the driveway.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Each night when I return the cab to
the garage I have to clean the come
off the back seat. Some nights I
clean off the blood.
INT. of TAXI GARAGE. TRAVIS pulls his taxi into garage
stall. TRAVIS reaches across the cab and extracts a small
vial of bennies from the glove compartment.
TRAVIS stands next to the cab, straightens his back, and
tucks the bottle of pills into his jacket pocket. He lowers
his head, looks into back seat, opens rear door and bends
inside.
He shakes a cigarette out of his pack of camels and lights
it.
SLIGHT TIMECUT: TRAVIS books it at garage office. Old, rotting
slabs of wood are screwed to a grey crumbling
concrete wall. Each available space is covered with handlettered signs, time schedules, check-out sheets, memos. The
signs read:
BE ALERT!!
THE SAFE DRIVER

FOR THE UNEXPECTED
SLOW DOWN
AND GAUGE SPEED TO

ACCIDENTS
MUST PHONE IN AT ONCE TO
JUDSON 2-3410
AND MUST FILE A REPORT Promptly AT 9 AM THE FOLLOWING MORNING
AT
43 W. 61ST.
A half dozen haggard cabbies hang around the office. Their
shirts are wrinkle, their heads dropping, the mouths
incessantly chattering. We pick up snatches of cabbie small
talk:
1ST CABBIE
... hadda piss like a bull steer, so
I pull over on 10th Ave, yank up the
hood and do the engine job.
(gestures as if taking
a piss into the hood)
There I am with my dong in my hand
when a guy come up and asks if I
need any help. Just checking the
battery, I says, and, meanwhile...
(takes imaginary piss)
2ND CABBIE
If he thinks I'm going up into The
Jungle this time of night, he can
shove it.
3RD CABBIE
(talking into pay
phone)
Fuck that Violets First. Fucking
saddle horse. No, no, the OTB. Fuck
them. No, it was TKR. TCR and I'da
made seven fucking grand. Fuck them
too. Alright, what about the second
race?
4TH CABBIE
Over at Love, this hooker took on
the whole garage. Blew the whole
fucking joint and they wouldn't even
let her use the drinking fountain.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> hands his trip sheet to a CAB OFFICIAL, nods slightly,
turns and walks toward the door.
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
OUTSIDE, TRAVIS walks pleasantly down Broadway, his hands in
his jacket pockets. The sidewalks are deserted, except for
diligent fruit and vegetable VENDORS setting up their stalls.
He takes a deep breath of fresh air, pulls a white pill from
his pocket, pops it into his mouth.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> turns a corner, keeps walking. Ahead of him is a 24-
hour PORNO THEATRE. The theatre, a blaze of cheap day-glow
reds and yellows, is an offense to the clear, crisp morning
air. The permanent lettering reads, "Adam Theatre, 16mm
Sound Features". Underneath, today's feature are handlettered: "Six-Day Cruise" and "Beaver Dam".
<char who="trav">Travis</char> stops at the box office, purchases a ticket, and walks
in.</scene>
<scene num="5">INT. PORNO THEATRE
<char who="trav">Travis</char> stands in the aisle for a moment. He turns around,
walking back toward the concession stand.
CONCESSION STAND
A plain dumpy-looking GIRL sits listlessly on a stool behind
the shabby concession stand. A plaster-of-Paris Venus de
Milo sits atop a piece of purple velvet cloth on the counter.
The SOUND of the feature drones in the background.
CONCESSION GIRL
Kin I help ya?
<char who="trav">Travis</char> rests his elbow on the counter, looking at the Girl.
He is obviously trying to be friendly - no easy task for
him.
God knows he needs a friend.
TRAVIS
What is your name? My name is Travis.
CONCESSION GIRL
Awh, come off it, Pal.
TRAVIS
No, I'm serious, really...
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
CONCESSION GIRL
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh?
That what you want?
CONCESSION GIRL
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a
big Coca-Cola - without ice - and a
large buttered popcorn, and...
(pointing)
... some of them chocolate covered
malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a
box. They last.
CONCESSION GIRL
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't
have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal
Crown Cola.
TRAVIS
That's fine.
CONCESSION GIRL
That's a dollar forty-seven.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> lays two dollar bills on the counter.
INT. THEATRE AUDITORIUM</scene>
<scene num="6">Slight TIMECUT to <char who="trav">Travis</char> sitting in theatre, drinking his
Royal Crown Cola, eating his popcorn and milk balls. His
eyes are fixed on the screen. A MALE VOICE emanates from the
screen:
MALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.)
Come here, bitch. I'm gonna split
you in half.
Male Voice yields to <char who="trav">Travis'</char> monotone narration.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Twelve hours of work and I still
cannot sleep. The days dwindle on
forever and do not end.</scene>
<scene num="7">FADE TO:
EXT. CHARLES PALANTINE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS
The Headquarters of the "New Yorkers for Charles Palantine
for President Committee", located at the corner of 50th Street
and Broadway, are festooned in traditional red, white and
blue banners, ribbons and signs.
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
One large sign proclaims "Palantine". Another sign reads
"Register for New York Primary, July 20.". The smiling middleaged face of Charles Palantine keeps watch over the bustling
pedestrians.
It is LATE AFTERNOON.</scene>
<scene num="8">INSIDE HEADQUARTERS
A variety of YOUNG WORKERS joke and chatter as they labor
through stacks of papers. The room is pierced with the sound
of ringing phones.
Seen from a distance - the only way <char who="trav">Travis</char> can see them -
those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, wellgroomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields
of Massachusetts and Connecticut.
CAMERA FAVORS BETSY, about 25, an extremely attractive woman
sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several
stacks of papers. Her attractions, however, are more than
skin deep. Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen,
though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every
man who passes her desk as her mind computes his desirability:
Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional, material. Simple
pose and status do not impress her; she seeks out the
extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in other words, starfucker of the highest order.
Betsy, putting down the phone, calls TOM, a lanky, amiable
and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk:
BETSY
Tom.
Tom is pleasant and good-looking, but lacks those special
qualities which interest Betsy. He gets nowhere with Betsy -
yet he keeps trying.
Just another of those routine office flirtations which pass
the hours and free the fantasies.
BETSY
Tom, come here a moment.
(he walks over)
I think this canvas report is about
ready to go out. Check it out with
Andy, and if he okays if, have a
copy made for the campaign
headquarters in every county.

BETSY (CONT'D)
(a beat)
And don't forget to add the new photo
releases.
TOM
The senator's white paper is almost
ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
BETSY
Andy usually just sends those to the
national media. The local press
doesn't know what to do with a
position paper until UPI and AP tell
them anyway.
TOM
I think we should try to get maximum
coverage for this new mandatory
welfare program. Push the issues.
BETSY
(as if instructing a
child)
First push the man, then the issue.
Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an
intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
TOM
You forgot "sexy".
BETSY
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
TOM
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
BETSY
Oh, Tom, please.
TOM
Well, for Christsakes, you sound
like you're selling... I don't know
what... cars... not issues.
BETSY
Have you ever wondered why CBS News
has the highest ratings?
TOM
More people watch it.
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:
BETSY
Alright, forget it if you're not
going to be serious,
TOM
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was
just...
BETSY
Just what?
TOM
Kidding around... you know, fun.
Betsy looks toward the street, then back at Tom.
BETSY
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in
a while, you'd get somewhere.
TOM
With who?
BETSY
Alright, now. You want to know why
CBS has the highest ratings? You
their news is any different from
NBC, ABC? It's all the same news.
Same stories. Same order usually.
What, you thought they had good news
for people, right? You thought that's
why people watched CBS? I'll tell
you why people watch CBS.
Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not
the news, not the issues, the man.
If Walter Cronkite told people to
eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling
cars, goddamn it.
Betsy's attention is being distracted by something she sees
across the street. She puts on her glasses and looks out
across the street again.
TOM
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why
don't we run him instead?
BETSY
That's the last. The finish. Period.
Some pople can learn. Some people
can't. And you wonder why we never
get serious----
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:
TOM
Sure we could run him. You realize
he's already of his block association.
BETSY
(looks across street
again)
Have you been noticing anything
strange?
TOM
No, why?
BETSY
Why's that taxi driver across the
street been staring at us?
TOM
What taxi driver?
BETSY
That taxi driver. The one that's
been sitting here.
TOM
How long has he been there?
BETSY
I don't know - but it feels like a
long time.
<char who="trav">Travis'</char> cold piercingly eyes Stare out from his cab parked
across the street from Palantine Headquarters. He is like a
lone wolf watching the warm campfires of civilization from a
distance. A thin red dot glows from his cigarette.
Tom exchanges <char who="trav">Travis'</char> gaze.
TOM
(determined)
Well, I'll go out and ask him.
As Tom walks toward front door Betsy's eyes alternate between
him and the position where <char who="trav">Travis</char> sits.
EXT. PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
Tom strides out the front door and walks briskly across the
street toward <char who="trav">Travis'</char> taxi.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> spots Tom walking toward him and quickly stares up
his cab, then squeals off in a burst of billowing exhaust.

<char who="trav">Travis'</char> taxi continues down Broadway.
CUT TO:
INT. TRAVIS' APARTMENT
He lies on his mattress at the ceiling. He is fully clothed
and appears deep in thought.
Near his mattress rest several medications: A large bottle
of vitamin pills, two smaller bottles of pills, a bottle of
peach-flavored brandy.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
All my life needed was a sense of
direction, a sense of someplace to
go. I do not believe one should
devote his life to morbid selfattention, but should become a person
like other people.</scene>
<scene num="9">ANOTHER DAY - LATE AFTERNOON
<char who="trav">Travis'</char> taxi is driving down Broadway with the "Off Duty"
sign on.
POV TRACKING SHOT down Broadway. CAMERA stops at Palantine
Campaign Headquarters. A few WORKERS remain in the office.
Betsy's desk is vacant.
FIFTH AVENUE - THE SAME AFTERNOON
CAMERA TRACKS with crowded mass of MANHATTANITES as they
ooze through the sidewalks toward their various destination.
Individuals are indiscernible: It is simply a congested mass.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I first saw her at Palantine Campaign
Headquarters at 58th and Broadway.
She was wearing a yellow dress,
answering the phone at her desk.
Suddenly: Cut of the congested human mass, IN SLOWING MOTION,
appears the slender figure of BETSY in a stylish yellow dress.
The crowd parts like the Red Sea, and there she is: Walking
all alone, untouched by the crowd, suspended in space and
time.

TRAVIS (V.O.)
She appeared like an angel out of
this open sewer. Out of this filthy
mass. She is alone: They cannot touch
her.</scene>

He is at the table, writing in his diary.
CLOSEUP - His stubby pencil rests on the word "her".</scene>
<scene num="11">CUT TO:
It is 3:30 IN THE MORNING in a bacon-shaped all night WEST
SIDE REATAURANT. The thick smell hangs in the air - fried
grease, smoke, sweat, regurgitated wine.
Whatever doesn't flush away in New York at night turns up in
places like this. A burly grease-stained COOK stands over
the grill. A JUNKIE shuffles from one side of the door to
another. Slouched over the small four-person formica tables
are several WELL-DRESSED BLACKS (too well-dressed for this
time and place), a cluster of STREET PEOPLE and a lost OLD
COOT who hangs onto his cup of coffee as if it were his last
possession.
The restaurant, brightly lit, perfectly conveys the image
urban plasticity - without the slightest hint of an
accompanying cleanliness.
Toward the rear of the restaurant sit three cabbies: WIZARD,
a worn man about fifty, DOUGH-BOY, younger family man, CHARLIE
T., fourtyish Black.
Wizard is telling Dough-Boy a story. Charlie T., his elbows
popped against table top, is not listening. He stares silently
down at a plate of cold scrambled eggs and a Racing Forum.
His eyes may not be open.
WIZARD
First she did her make-up. You know,
I hate it when they do that.
I mean she does the whole works, the
mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick,
the rouge...
DOUGH-BOY
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
WIZARD
The kind with a brush.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
<char who="trav">Travis</char> appears at the door. He has to push aside the JUNKIES
to enter without making physical contact - something Travis
would not relish. He may be repulsed with these people and
this place, but he is too much a part of this to let his
feelings rise to the surface.
Wizard gives <char who="trav">Travis</char> a perfunctory wave.
WIZARD
Travis.
TRAVIS
Hey Wizard.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> straddles a seat at the table. Dough-Boy gives Travis
something between a wink and an eye-twitch saying:
DOUGH-BOY
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses
it,
WIZARD
(ironic)
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee.
WIZARD
(continuing)
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she
used it. And then the spray perfume.
You know, the real sweat kind -
and, on top of that, get this,
right when we're crossing the Triboro
bridge - she changes her pantyhose!
DOUGH-BOY
No.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> turns his head. He appears not to be interested, but
is.

WIZARD
Threw on the emergency, jumped the
seat and fucked her brains out -
What do you think!
(they laugh)
What do I have to do? Draw you a

DOUGH-BOY
Yeah.
WIZARD
What was I supposed to do? I was
watching in the rear view. You know,
just checkin' traffic.
(to Travis)
So howsit?
TRAVIS
(w/o inflection)
Some fleet driver for Bell just cut
up. Just heard it on the radio.
DOUGH-BOY
Stick up?
A WAITRESS brings <char who="trav">Travis'</char> coffee and a glass of water. He
asks for a cheeseburger.
WIZARD
Sure. What do you think? She wanted
to get out of the cab. I said "Look,
you're in the middle of the fucking
bridge..."
DOUGH-BOY
You said that?
WIZARD
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're
on a bridge..."
DOUGH-BOY

She stayed in the cab, what's she

A real skunk.
Wizard realizes <char who="trav">Travis</char> and Dough-Boy may not have met.
WIZARD

Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie

Charlie T. nods sleepily. <char who="trav">Travis</char> indicates he knows DoughBoy.
DOUGH-BOY
Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
(laughs)
WIZARD
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes
the dollars. He'll chase a buck
straight into Jersey.
DOUGH-BOY
Look who's talking?
(gestures around table)
Who else would stay up all night to

<char who="trav">Travis</char> sips his coffee. Charlie T.'s eyelids slip shut.

In the jungle. 122nd.</scene>
<scene num="12"><char who="trav">Travis'</char> eyes turn toward the restaurant's other patrons.
POV: THREE STREET PEOPLE sitting at a table. One GUY, stoned,
stares straight ahead. A raggedly attractive GIRL rest her
head on the shoulder of the other, a heavily bearded YOUNG
MAN with a headband. They kiss and tease each other,
momentarily lost in their separate world.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> watches the hippie couple closely, his feeling sharply
divided between cultural contempt and morose jealousy.
Why should these people enjoy the love and intimacy that has
always eluded him? He must enjoy these schizoid emotions,
because his eyes dwell on the couple.
DOUGH-BOY
(changing the subject)
You run all over town, don't you,
Travis?
WIZARD
(referring to 122nd

Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it

<char who="trav">Travis</char> turns back to his companions.
TRAVIS
Huh?
DOUGH-BOY
I mean, you handle some pretty rough

You carry a piece? You need one?
TRAVIS
Nah.

Waitress slaps down smudge-marked glass of water, and a

WIZARD
The cops and company raise hell they

DOUGH-BOY
For a fee.
WIZARD
I never use mine. But it's a good

DOUGH-BOY

Tom and Betsy are talking. She takes out a cigarette. He
takes out matches to light it.
BETSY
Try holding the match like this.
TOM
This is gotta be a game, right?
BETSY
(putting on glasses)
This I gotta see.
TOM
(burning fingers)
Ouch!
BETSY
(giggling)
Oh, are you all right?
TOM
I'm great. Always set my fingers on
fire. If you want to see another
trick. I do this thing with my nose.
BETSY
No. I just wanted to see if you could
light it that way. The guy at the
newsstand can.
TOM
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand,
Mr. Asbestos...
BETSY
He happens to be missing fingers. I
first noticed when -

TOM
Is he Italian?
BETSY
No, why?
TOM
You sure he's not Italian?
BETSY
He's Black, OK?
TOM
Well, If he had been Italian, they
could have been shot off. Sometimes
the mob does that to teach guys a
lesson, If they blow a job or
something.
BETSY
As I said, he isn't Italian.
Besides, I thought they just killed
them.
TOM
Don't be naive. They can't kill
everybody. They have different
punishments for different things.
Like, if they kill a stoo pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.
It's symbolic.
BETSY
Why don't they leave a pidgeon instead
of a canary?
TOM
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave
a canary. Don't be technical. What
I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's
Italian and his fingers are gone,
maybe he's a thief.
BETSY
First, he's not Italian. Second he's
not a thief. I noticed the fingers
when he was getting my change - the
right change. Two of his fingers are
missing. Just stubs. Like they were
blown away. I was putting my change
in my purse when I saw him get out a
cigarette. I couldn't help watching.

BETSY (CONT'D)
I was dying to see how he'd light
it.
TOM
With the other hand, right?
BETSY
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's
the whole point.
TOM
I know that guy. His hand looks like
a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand

BETSY
No, this is young - well, I'm never
sure how old Black people are -
but, anyway, he isn't old. That's
for sure.
TOM
Show me how he did that again.</scene>
<scene num="14">EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM HEADQUARTERS
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is striding briskly across Broadway toward the
Palantine Headquarters.
He s dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not jeans)
are pressed, his boots shined, his hair combed. Under his
Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy league
tie. He drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in.
Watching <char who="trav">Travis</char> enter Palantine's Headquarters, we are
surprised to realize that <char who="trav">Travis</char> is really quite attractive.
His deformities are psychological, not physical. He believes
he is cursed, and therefore he is.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> walks briskly into the office, and heads toward Betsy's
desk. Tom walks over to greet him, but <char who="trav">Travis</char> ignores him.
TRAVIS
(at Betsy's desk)
I want to volunteer.
As the CAMERA examines <char who="trav">Travis'</char> face more closely, one can
see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient
diet.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
TOM
(at Betsy's desk)
If you'll come this way.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> elbows Tom off.
TRAVIS
(to Betsy)
No. I want to volunteer to you.
TOM
(under his voice)
Bets.
BETSY waves TOM off with a short gesture, indicating
everything is OK. He walks away.
BETSY
(curious)
And why is that?
TRAVIS is on his best behavior. He smiles slightly:
TRAVIS
Because you are the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.
BETSY is momentarily taken back, but pleased. TRAVIS' presence
has a definite sexual charge. He has those star qualities
BETSY looks for: She senses there is something special about
the young man who stands before her. And then, too, there is
that disarming smile. He is, as Betsy would say,
"fascinating".
BETSY
(smiling)
Is that so?
(pause)
But what do you think of Charles
Palantine?
TRAVIS
(his mind elsewhere)
Who mam?
BETSY
Charles Palantine. The man you want
to volunteer to help elect president.
TRAVIS
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man.
Make a great, great President.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
BETSY
You want to canvass?
TRAVIS
Yes, mam.
Betsy is interviewing Travis, but she is also teasing him a
little, leading him on in a gentle feminine way:
BETSY
How do you feel about Senator
Palantine's stand on welfare?
This takes TRAVIS back a bit. He obviously doesn't have the
slightest idea what Palantine's stand on welfare is, in fact,
he doesn't have any idea about politics whatsoever.
TRAVIS thinks a moment, then improvises an answer:
TRAVIS
Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's
right. People should work for a
living. I do. I like to work. Every
day. Get those old coots off welfare
and make 'em work for a change.
Betsy does a subtle double-take: This isn't exactly
Palantine's position on welfare. She remain intrigued by
Travis.
BETSY
Well, that's not exactly what the
Senator has proposed. You might not
want to canvass, but there is plenty
more other work we need done: Office
work, filing, poster hanging.
TRAVIS
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real
good worker.
BETSY
(gesturing)
if you talk to Tom, he'll assign you
to something.
TRAVIS
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather
work for you.
BETSY
Well, we're all working tonight.
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at
night.
BETSY
Well, then, what is it you exactly
want to do?
TRAVIS
(bolstering courage)
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty
pleased if you'd go out and have
some coffee and pie with me.
Betsy doesn't quite know what to make of Travis. She is
curious, intrigued, tantalized. Like a moth, she draws closer
to the flame.
BETSY
Why?
TRAVIS
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this
place here in my taxi many times a
day. And I watch you sitting here at
this big long desk with these
telephones, and I say to myself,
that's a lonely girl. She needs a
friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
(smiles)
<char who="trav">Travis</char> rarely smiles, but when he does his whole face glows.
It is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm
unknown even to himself. Betsy is completely disarmed.
BETSY
I don't know...
TRAVIS
It's just to the corner, mam. In
broad daytime. Nothing can happen.
I'll be there to protect you.
BETSY
(smiles)
All right.
(relents)
All right. I'm taking a break at
four o'clock. If you're here then
we'll go to the corner and have some
coffee and pie.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam.
I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.
(pause)
And... ah... Betsy...
BETSY
Yes?
TRAVIS
My name is Travis.
BETSY
Thank you, Travis.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> nods, turns and exits.
Tom, who has been watching this interchange with a pseudostandoffish (actually jealous) air, steps over to Betsy. His
manner demands some sort of explanation of what Betsy was
doing.
Betsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and
says:
BETSY
I'm just going to find out what the
cabbies are thinking.</scene>
<scene num="15">CUT TO:
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the
Palantine Headquarters. He checks his watch.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
April 26, 1972. Four o'clock p.m. I
took Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee
Shop on Broadway...
INT. COFFEE SHOP
<char who="trav">Travis</char> and Betsy are sitting in a booth of a small New York
Coffee Shop. They both have been served coffee; <char who="trav">Travis</char> is
nervously turning his cup around in his hands.
As <char who="trav">Travis</char> speaks V.O., WAITRESS brings their orders: Apple
pie for TRAVIS, fruit compote for BETSY.
(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.
I think that was a good selection.
Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad
dish. She could have had anything
she wanted.
Betsy's conversation interrupts <char who="trav">Travis'</char> V.O.:
BETSY
We've signed up 15.000 Palantine
volunteers in New York so far. The
organizational problems are becoming
just staggering.
TRAVIS
I know what you mean. I've got the
same problems. I just can't get things
organized. Little things, I mean.
Like my room, my possessions.
I should get one of those signs that
says, "One of these days I'm Gonna
Organezizied".
<char who="trav">Travis</char> contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation,
than breaks into a big, friendly, infectious grin. The very
sight of it makes one's heart proud.
Betsy cannot help but be caught up in <char who="trav">Travis'</char> gin. <char who="trav">Travis'</char>
contagious, quicksilver moods cause:
BETSY
(laughing)
Travis, I never ever met anybody
like you before.
TRAVIS
I can believe that.
BETSY
Where do you live?
TRAVIS
(evasive)
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint.
It ain't much.
BETSY
So why did you decide to drive a
taxi at night?
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
I had a regular job for a while,
days. You know, doin' this, doin'
that. But I didn't have anything to
do at night. I got kinda lonely, you
know, just wandering around. So I
decided to works nights. It ain't
good to be alone, you know.
BETSY
After this job, I'm looking forward
to being alone for a while.
TRAVIS
Yeah, well...
(a beat)
In a cab you get to meet people.
You meet lotsa people. It's good for
you.
BETSY
What kind of people?
TRAVIS
Just people people, you know. Just
people.
(a beat)
Had a dead man once.
BETSY
Really?
TRAVIS
He'd been shot. I didn't know that.
He just crawled into the back seat,
said "West 45th Street" and conked
out.
BETSY
What did you do?
TRAVIS
I shot the meter off, for one thing.
I knew I wasn' going to get paid.
Then I dropped him off at the cop
shop. They took him.
BETSY
That's really something.
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in
a cab. Especially when the moon's
out.
BETSY
The moon?
TRAVIS
The full moon. One night I had three
or four weirdoes in a row and I looked
up and, sure enough, there it was -
the full moon.
Betsy laughs. <char who="trav">Travis</char> continues:
TRAVIS
Oh, yeah. People will do anything in
front of a taxi driver. I mean
anything. People too cheap to rent a
hotel room, people scoring dope,
people shooting up, people who want
to embarrass you.
(a bitterness emerges)
It's like you're not even there, not
even a person. Nobody knows you.
Betsy cuts <char who="trav">Travis'</char> bitterness short:
BETSY
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad.
I take lots of taxis.
TRAVIS
I know. I could have picked you up.
BETSY
Huh?
TRAVIS
Late one night. About three. At the
plaza.
BETSY
Three in the morning? I don't think
so. I have to go to bed early. I
work days. It must have been somebody
else.
TRAVIS
No. It was you. You had some manila
folders and a pink bag from Saks.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
Betsy, realizing <char who="trav">Travis</char> remembers her precisely, scrambles
for a polite rationale for her behavior:
BETSY
You're right! Now I remember! It was
after the Western regional planners
were in town and the meeting went
late. The next day I was completely
bushed. It was unbelievable.
TRAVIS
If it wasn't for a drunk I would
have picked you up. He wanted to go
to the DMZ.
BETSY
The DMZ?
TRAVIS
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to
ditch him, but he was already in the
cab, so I had to take him. That's
the law. Otherwise I would have picked
you up.
BETSY
That would have been quite a
coincidence.
TRAVIS
You'd be surprised how often you see
the same people, get the same fare.
People have patterns. They do more
or less the same things every day. I
can tell.
BETSY
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every
night.
TRAVIS
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary
people. A guy I know - Dough-Boy -
met his wife that way. They got to
talking. She said she usually caught
the bus so he started picking her up
at the bus stop, taking her home
with the flag up.
BETSY
That's very romantic. Some of your
fares must be interesting. See any

stars, politicians, deliver any babies
yet?
TRAVIS
Well, no... not really... had some
famous people in the cab.
(remembering)
I got this guy who makes lasers.
Not regular lasers, not the big kind.
Little lasers, pocket sized, small
enough to clip your belt like a
transistor radio, like a gun, you
know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
BETSY
(laughs)
What hours do you work?
TRAVIS
I work a single, which means there's
no replacement - no second man on
the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight.
Seventy-two hours a week.
BETSY
(amazed)
You mean you work seventy-two hours
a week.
TRAVIS
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I
squeeze a few more hours in the
morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred
miles a night.
BETSY
You must be rich.
TRAVIS
(big affectionate
smile)
It keeps ya busy.
BETSY
You know what you remind me of?
TRAVIS
What?

BETSY
That song by Kris Kristofferson,
where it's said "Like a pusher, party
truth, partly fiction, a walking
contradiction".
(smiles)
TRAVIS
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never
have pushed.
TRAVIS
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the
part about the contradiction.
TRAVIS
(more at ease)
Oh. Who was that again?
BETSY
The singer?
TRAVIS
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too
much.
BETSY

<char who="trav">Travis</char> is walking confusedly around SAM GOODY'S at MIDDAY,

<char who="trav">Travis</char> is lost among the hip, young intellectual type that

help, unable to come right out and requests what he desires.
A young SALESGIRL sees his plight, walks over and asks if he

CONTINUED:
Lengthy POV SHOT from <char who="trav">Travis'</char> vantage point behind the wheel.
We see the city as <char who="trav">Travis</char> sees it. The front windshield is a
little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right
screen. The intercom crackles with STATIC and MESSAGES.
The light turns green; we take off with a start. A short
first gear - quick shift - a long second gear. The cab eases
to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares.
Our eyes scan the long lines of PEDESTRIANS. The regular -
bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies -
they mean nothing now. They only blend into the sidewalks
and lighted storefronts.
Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the
curb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head?
In the next block there are perhaps three, four fares - quick
gas-up through this yellow light - brake sharply - check the
action. The first: Tourist, nickel tipper - let the next guy
pick them up. Let the second go also, the third - there's a
live fare. Middle-aged LOCAL WOMAN: Short fare to the East
Side, good tip.
We pull to the curb, waiting for her to get in. It is a long
wait - a Black STREET WALKER crosses in front of the cab. We
focus on (as <char who="trav">Travis</char> would) a YOUNG COUPLE embracing in the
distance.
As we travel, we hear <char who="trav">Travis'</char> random thoughts about selecting
fares and tips:
TRAVIS (V.O.)
You work at night, you get an
instinct. You can smell them. The
big tippers, the stiffs, the trouble
makers. Quarter is good tip for
Manhattan. Queens is better, Brooklyn
is best. go for the guys with
suitcases. The rich are the worst
tippers, hooks are lousy. Spooks
are okay, but they don't live at
Park Ave after all.
The meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. A
quick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says softly,
"192 East 89". We take off with another jolt. Cross back up
9th Ave, then cut through the park.
We're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we string
together?
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but quickly steps back
again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be a $1.40 fare.
Now through the park and we're almost there. Check the numbers -
134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40.
Check back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quarters
and a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35.
The tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We take
off again with a jolt.
This is <char who="trav">Travis'</char> world: Dark side streets, garish glaring
main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen
instantaneous decisions a minute. Are these people, are these
objects?</scene>
<scene num="17">EXT. TRAVIS' TAXI speed down darkened street.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I called Betsy again at her office,
and she said maybe we could go to a
movie together after she gets off
work tomorrow. That's my day off.
At first she hesitated, but I called her again and she agreed.

Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask
her last name again. Damn. I've got
to remember stuff like that.
<char who="trav">Travis'</char> thoughts are with Betsy, as THREE MEN enter <char who="trav">Travis'</char>
cab. He activates the meter and pulls off.
MAN'S VOICE
St. Regis Hotel.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> checks the mirror. Scanning across the back seat, he
recognizes the middle passenger. It is CHARLES PALANTINE,
candidate for President. He must have left the Hotel shortly
after BETSY.
Tom, seated on the jump seat, checks his watch and speaks
deferentially to Palantine:

PALANTINE

Yes I am.

Well, I'm one of your biggest

vote for you.
PALANTINE

check <char who="trav">Travis'</char> license)
Why, thank you Travis.

I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody
I know is going to vote for you.

I was going to put one of your
stickers on my taxi but the company
said it was against their policy.

I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned
more about this country sitting in
taxi cabs than in the board room of
General Motors.
