<speaker v.o.="Speaking, Palantine">PALANTINE</speaker>
<char who="trav">Travis</char>, what single thing would you
want the next President of this
country to do most?
<speaker v.o.="Speaking, Travis">TRAVIS</speaker>
I don't know, sir. I don't follow
political issues much.
<speaker v.o.="Speaking, Palantine">PALANTINE</speaker>
There must be something...
<speaker v.o.="Speaking, Travis">TRAVIS</speaker>
<par>(thinks)</par>
Well, he should clean up this city
here. It's full of filth and scum.
Scum and filth. It's like an open
sewer. I can hardly take it. Some
days I go out and smell it then I
get headaches that just stay and
never go away. We need a President
that would clean up this whole mess.
Flush it out.
Palantine is not a Hubert Humphrey-type professional
bullshitter, and <char who="trav">Travis'</char> intense reply stops him dead in his
tracks. He is forced to fall back on a stock answer but tries
to give it some meaning.
PALANTINE
(after a pause)
I know what you mean, Travis, and
it's not going to be easy. We're
going to have to make some radical
changes.
TRAVIS
(turning the wheel)
Damn straight.
EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL
TRAVIS' taxi pulls up in front of the Barclay Hotel.
PALANTINE and AIDE get out of the cab. SECOND AIDE stays in
back seat a moment to pay TRAVIS.
PALANTINE looks in front window of cab momentarily and nods
goodbye to TRAVIS.
PALANTINE
Nice talking to you, Travis.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
(calling back)
Thank you, sir. You're a good man,
sir.
<char who="trav">Travis'</char> taxi departs.
PALANTINE and AIDES walk up carpet to the St. Regis.
CAMERA CLOSES IN on PALANTINE as he stops, turns back and
watches <char who="trav">Travis'</char> departing taxi.
PALANTINE turns back and ascends the hotel steps with his
AIDES.
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING
TRAVIS, dressed to the teeth, walks brightly down the
sidewalk. His face is frehsly shaved, his hair combed, his
tie straightened.
He pauses in a store window to check his appearance.
Under his arm he carries the gift-wrapped Kristofferson record
album.
OUTSIDE PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
BETSY, smartly dressed, waves goodbye to another CAMPAIGN
WORKER and walks out the door to greet him.
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS and BETSY are walking down
Broadway toward Times Square. BETSY does not let their bodies
touch as they walk although TRAVIS contemplates edging closer
to her.
Betsy has opened the package and is admiring the record -
or, rather, <char who="trav">Travis'</char> sentiment behind giving it.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> looks around himself with pride: This is a moment in
his life - one of the few.
BETSY
You didn't have to spend your money -
?
TRAVIS
(interrupting)
He'll, what else can I do with it
all?
Betsy notices that the seal on the record has not been broken.
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
BETSY
Travis, you haven't even played the
record?
TRAVIS
(evasive)
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke.
But I'm sure the record is OK.
BETSY
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly
stand that. I live on music.
TRAVIS
I don't follow music much. I'd like
to though.
(second thought)
Honest.
BETSY
(pointing to album)
So you haven't heard this record
yet?
TRAVIS
No.
(sly smile)
I thought maybe you could play it
for me on your player.
Betsy's face backtracks a bit. Maybe she was wrong to go out
with this fellow she doesn't know.
She makes a polite laugh.
LATER. <char who="trav">Travis</char> and Betsy are in TIMES SQUARE, turning the
corner from Broadway to 42nd Street. <char who="trav">Travis</char> carries the
album under his arm.
They approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno
theatre advertising "The Swedish Marriage Manual". The box
office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with
explicit publicity stills. Offending portions have been
blocked out with black tape.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets.
Betsy, befuddled, watches him. She doesn't know what to say.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> returns with the tickets.
Betsy still has not fully comprehended what is happening:
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
BETSY
What are you doing?
TRAVIS
(innocent)
I bought a couple of tickets.
BETSY
But this is a porno movie.
TRAVIS
No, these are the kind that couples
go to. They're not like the other
movies. All kinds of couples go.
Honest. I've seen them.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> seems confused. He is so much part of his own world,
he fails to comprehend another's world. Compared to the movies
he sees, this is respectable. But then there's also something
that <char who="trav">Travis</char> could not even acknowledge, much less admit:
That he really wants to get this pure white girl into that
dark porno theatre.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> makes an awkward gesture to escort Betsy into the
theatre. Betsy looks at the tickets, at the theatre, at
Travis. She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the
turnstile. She thinks to herself: "What the Hell. What can
happen?" She's always been curious about these pictures
anyway, and - like all women, no matter how intelligent -
she's been raised not to offend her date. A perverse logic
which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like
these.
INSIDE THE THEATER
<char who="trav">Travis</char> escorts Betsy to an empty center row. <char who="trav">Travis</char> was right.
Couples do go to films like this. There are at least six or
seven other MEN with their bewigged "DATES".
<char who="trav">Travis</char> settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch. Betsy
looks curiously from side to side.
ON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is
speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in
a happy marriage. Subtitles translate her words. Then,
without warning, there is a direct CUT to a couple copulating
on a sterile table-like bed.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> watches intently. The color, however, is slowly
draining from Betsy's cheeks. One thought fills her mind:
"What am I doing here?"
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
(to himself)
Damn.
BETSY
What's wrong?
TRAVIS
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
That does it. Betsy just looks at him for a moment, then
gets up and starts to leave. Travis, confused, hustles after
her.
He follows her out of the theatre.
ON THE SIDEWALK
<char who="trav">Travis</char> catches up with her.
TRAVIS
Where are you going?
BETSY
I'm leaving.
TRAVIS
What do you mean?
Betsy looks at Travis, trying to understand him:
BETSY
These are not the kind of movies I
go to.
TRAVIS
Well, I don't follow movies too
much...
BETSY
You mean these are the only kind of
movies you go to?
The TICKET GIRL watches expressionlessly from the booth.
TRAVIS
This is sort of high class...
BETSY
I mean porno movies.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
(hesitant)
Well... mostly...
BETSY
My God!
TRAVIS
We can go to another movie if you
like, I don't care. I got money.
There's plenty...
<char who="trav">Travis</char> gestures toward the long row of 42nd Street marquees,
but is interrupted by Betsy:
BETSY
If you just wanted to fuck, why didn't
you just come right out and say it?
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is flabbergasted by Betsy's blunt language. His arm
still gestures toward the marquees, his lips continue to
move, but words do not come out.
Unable to respond to Betsy's question, <char who="trav">Travis</char> picks up where
he left off:
TRAVIS
... there's plenty of movies around
here. I haven't seen any of them,
but I'm sure they're good.
BETSY
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and
all that, but I think this is it.
I'm going home.
TRAVIS
(interrupting)
You mean you don't want to go to a
movie?
(a beat)
There's plenty of movies around here.
BETSY
No, I don't feel so good. We're just
two very different kinds of people,
that's all.
TRAVIS
(puzzled)
Huh?
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
BETSY
It's very simple. You go your way,
I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
TRAVIS
But... Betsy...
BETSY
I'm getting a taxi.
She walks to the curb.
TRAVIS
(following her)
What about the record?
BETSY
Keep it.
TRAVIS
Can I call you?
Betsy looks for a cab.
TRAVIS
(tender)
Please, Betsy, I bought it for you.
Betsy looks at his sad, sweet face and relents a bit.
BETSY
All right, I'll accept the record.
Betsy accepts the record, but quickly turns and hails a taxi.
BETSY
Taxi!
A taxi quickly pulls up.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> feebly protests to no one in particular:
TRAVIS
But I got a taxi.
Betsy gives instructions to CAB DRIVER, looks briefly back
at Travis, then straight ahead. Taxi speeds off.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> looks around helplessly: A cluster of PEDESTRIANS on
the crowded street has stopped to watch the argument. Travis
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
looks back at the woman in the porno theatre box office who
has also been following the argument.
CUT TO:
INSIDE TRAVIS' APARTMENT
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is sitting at the table. There are some new items on
the table: His giant econo-sized bottle of vitamins, a giant
econo-sized bottle of aspirins, a pint of apricot brandy, a
partial loaf of cheap white bread.
On the wall behind the table hang two more items: A gag sign
reading "One of These Days I'm Gonna Get Organezizied" and
an orange-and-black bumper sticker for Charles Palantine.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
May 8, 1972. My life has taken another
turn again. The days move along with
regularity...
C.U. of notebook: <char who="trav">Travis</char> is no longer sitting at the desk.
The pencil rests on the open notebook.
LATER THAT DAY: TRAVIS has pulled his straight-backed chair
around and is watching his small portable TV, which rests on
the upright melon crate.
A cereal bowl partially filled with milk rests in his lap.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> pours a couple shots of the apricot brandy into the
bowl, dips folded chunks of white bread into the mixture,
and eats them.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is watching early evening NEWS PROGRAM. TV background
SOUND. Charles Palantine is being interviewed somewhere on
the campaign trail.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
... one day indistinguishable from
the next, a long continuous chain,
then suddenly - there is a change.
Betsy is walking down a midtown street when <char who="trav">Travis</char> suddenly
appears before her. He has been waiting.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> tries to make conversation but she doesn't listen.
She motions for him to go away and keeps on walking.
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
Travis, protesting, follows.
CUT TO:
INT. BUILDING - DAY
<char who="trav">Travis</char> speaks intensely into a wall pay phone.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I tried to call her several times.
We hear <char who="trav">Travis'</char> Voice on the phone.
TRAVIS
(smoking a cigarette)
you feeling better? You said you
didn't feel so good...
TRAVIS (V.O.)
But after the first call, she would
no longer come to the phone.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> holds the receiver in his hand. The other party has
hung up.
TRACKING SHOT across interior lower wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT.
Against the stark wall there is a row of wilted and dying
floral arrangements. Each one of the four or five bouquets
is progressively more wilted than the one closer to the door.
They have been returned.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I also sent flowers with no luck. I
should not dwell on such things, but
set them behind me. The smell of the
flowers only made me sicker.
The headaches got worse I think I've got stomach cancer. I
should not complain so. "You're only as healthy as you feel."
A drama is acted out at PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS: Travis,
groggy and red-eyed from lack of sleep, walks into the
campaign headquarters about NOONTIME.
Betsy is standing near the rear of the office; she ducks
from sight when she sees <char who="trav">Travis</char> enter. <char who="trav">Travis'</char> path is cut
short by Tom's large-framed body. There is no live sound.
(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I realize now how much she is like
the others, so cold and distant.
Many people are like that. They're
like a union.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> tries to push his way past Tom but Tom grabs him.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> says something sharply to Tom and the two scuffle.
Tom, by far the taller and stronger, quickly overcomes Travis,
wrenching his arm behind his back.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> kicks and protests as Tom leads him to the front door.
ON THE SIDEWALK
<char who="trav">Travis'</char> efforts quickly subside when Tom motions to a nearby
POLICEMAN. <char who="trav">Travis</char> quiets down and walks off.
CUT TO:
EXT.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is again making his way through the garish urban night.
He stops for a PASSENGER on PARK AVE. A middle-aging
professorial executive.
C.U. TRAVIS: His face is expressionless. The MAN makes
himself comfortable in the back seat.
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
Jackson Heights.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> has no intention of driving out to Jackson Heights
and coming back with a fare.
TRAVIS
I'm off duty.
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
You mean you don't want to go out to
Jackson Heights?
TRAVIS
No, I'm off duty.
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
Then how come your "Off Duty" light
wasn't on.
TRAVIS switches on the "Off Duty" light.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
It was on.
(gesturing toward top
of taxi)
it just takes a while to warm up.
Like a TV.
TRAVIS doesn't budge. PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER curses to himself
and exits cab. <char who="trav">Travis</char> takes off.
POV as <char who="trav">Travis'</char> eyes dwell on the young HIP COUPLES coming
out of a East Side movie house.
LATER THAT NIGHT, TRAVIS pulls over for a young (midtwenties) MAN wearing a leather sports jacket.
TRAVIS eyes his passenger in rear-view mirror.
YOUNG PASSENGER
471 Central Park West.
EXT.
TRAVIS' taxi speeds off.
LATER, TRAVIS' taxi slows down as it approaches 400 block of
Central Park West.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> checks apartment numbers.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Just pull over to the curb a moment.
TRAVIS turns the wheel.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Yeah, that's fine. Just sit here.
TRAVIS waits impassively. The motor ticks away.
After a long pause, the PASSENGER speaks:
YOUNG PASSENGER
Cabbie, ya see that light up there
on the seventh floor, three windows
from this side of the building?
CAMERA CLOSES IN on 417 Central Park West: TRACKING UP to
the seventh floor, it moves three windows to the right.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Yeah.
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
A young WOMAN wearing a slip crosses in front of the light.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
Ya see that woman there?
TRAVIS (O.S.)
Yeah.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
That's my wife.
(a beat)
But it ain't my apartment.
(a beat)
A nigger lives there.
(a beat)
She left me two weeks ago. It took
me this long to find out where she
went.
(a beat)
I'm gonna kill her.
C.U. TRAVIS' face: it is devoid of expression.
YOUNG PASSENGER
What do you think of that, cabbie?
C.U. YOUNG PASSENGER's face: it is gaunt, drained of blood,
full of fear and anger.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> does not respond.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Huh?
(a beat)
What do you think of that, huh?
<char who="trav">Travis</char> shrugs, gesturing toward meter.
YOUNG PASSENGER
I'm gonna kill her with a .44 Magnum
pistol.
CAMERA returns to SEVENTH FLOOR WINDOW. Woman is standing in
the light.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
Did you ever see what a .44 can do
to a woman's face, cabbie?
(pause)
Did you ever see what it can do to a
woman's pussy, cabbie?
<char who="trav">Travis</char> says nothing.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
I'm going to put it right up to her,
cabbie. Right in her, cabbie.
You must think I'm real sick, huh?
A real pervert. Sitting here and
talking about a woman's pussy and a
.44, huh?
CAMERA CLOSES IN on <char who="trav">Travis'</char> face: He is watching the woman
in the seventh floor window with complete and total
absorption. It's the same glazed-over stare we saw in his
eyes as he watched the porno movie.
FADE TO:
BROOKLYN STREET CORNER - DAY
<char who="trav">Travis</char> stands near the corner wearing his boots, jeans,
western shirt and army jacket.
He pulls his aspiring bottle out of his pocket, shakes three
or four into his palm, pops them into his mouth and chews.
An "Off Duty" taxi pulls up to the curb. <char who="trav">Travis</char> gets in.
INSIDE TAXI
Dough-Boy leans back from the wheel and greets <char who="trav">Travis</char> as he
enters.
DOUGH-BOY
Hey Travis. This here's Easy Andy.
He's a travelling salesman.
In the back seat, beside Travis, sits ANDY, an attractive
young man about 29. He wears a pin-striped suit, white shirt
and floral tie. His hair is modishly long.
ANDY
Hello Travis.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> nods as the taxi speeds off.
Dough-Boy slows down near an economy hotel. Not a flop house,
but not do fancy they care what the guests do in the privacy
of their rooms.
ANDY
This is fine, Dough-Boy
(to Travis)
Pay Dough-Boy here.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
<char who="trav">Travis</char> pulls a twenty out of his pocket and gives it to DoughBoy.
TRAVIS
20 bucks?
DOUGH-BOY
(takes bill)
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice,
Travis.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> and Andy get out of the cab and walk toward the hotel.
Dough-Boy pulls away.
As they enter the hotel, they pass a JUNKIE, stoned out and
spread-eagled across the hood of a derelict old blue dodge.
INT. HOTEL
<char who="trav">Travis</char> follows Andy up the worn carpeted stairs and down the
hallway. Andy unlocks the door to one of the rooms.
The HOTEL ROOM is barren and clean; there's no sign anyone
is staying in it. The fire escape is appropriately near.
Andy locks the door behind them, steps over to the closet,
unlocks it and pulls out two grey Samsonite suitcases - the
kind you can drive a truck over.
ANDY
Dough-Boy probably told you I don't
carry any Saturday Night Specials or
crap like that. It's all out of
State, clean, brand new, top-ofthe-line stuff.
Andy places the suitcases on the white bedspread. The
suitcases are equipped with special locks, which he quickly
opens.
Andy opens the suitcases: Stacked in grey packing foam are
rows and rows of brand new hand guns.
TRAVIS
You got a .44 Magnum?
ANDY
That's an expensive gun.
TRAVIS
I got money.
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
Andy unzips a cowhide leather pouch to reveal a .44 Magnum
pistol. He holds it gingerly, as if it were a precious
treasure. Andy opens the chambers and cradles the long eightinch barrel in his palm. The .44 is a huge, oversize inhuman
gun.
ANDY
(admiringly)
It's a monster. Can stop a car --
put a bullet right into the block.
A premium high resale gun. $350 --
that's only a hundred over list.
Easy Andy is a later version of the fast-talking, goodlooking kid in college who was always making money on one
scheme or another. In high school he sold lottery tickets,
in college he scored dope, and now he's hustling hand guns.
Andy holds the Magnum out for <char who="trav">Travis'</char> inspection. There's a
worshipful CLOSEUP of the .44 Magnum. It is a monster.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> hefts the huge gun. It seems out of place in his hand.
It is built on Michelangelo's scale. The Magnum belongs in
the hand of a marble god, not a slight taxi driver. Travis
hands the gun back to Andy.
ANDY
I could sell this gun in Harlem for
$500 today - but I just deal high
quality goods to high quality people.
(pause)
Now this may be a little big for
practical use, in which case I'd
recommend the .38 Smith and Wesson
Special. Fine solid gun - nickel
plated. Snub-nosed, otherwise the
same as the service revolver. Now
that'll stop anything that moves and
it's handy, flexible. The Magnum,
you know, that's only if you want to
splatter it against the wall. The
movies have driven up the price of
the Magnum anyway. Everybody wants
them now. But the Wesson .38 - only
$250 - and worth every dime of it.
(he hefts the .38)
Throw in a holster for $10.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> hefts the nickel-plated .38, points it out the window.
(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:
ANDY
Some of these guns are like toys,
but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can
hit somebody over the head with it
and it will still come back dead on.
Nothing beats quality.
(pause)
You interested in an automatic?
TRAVIS
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm
gun. That .22 there.
ANDY
That's the Colt .25 - a fine little
gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but
it's as fast as the Devil. Handy
little gun, you can carry it almost
anywhere. I'll throw it in for another
$125.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> holds the .32 Revolver, hefts it, slips it under his
belt and pulls his shirt over it. He turns from side to side,
to see how it rides in his waist.
TRAVIS
How much for everything.
ANDY
The .32's $150 - and you're really
getting a good deal now - and all
together it comes to, ah, seven eightyfive for four pieces and a holster.
He'll, I'll give you the holster,
we'll make it seventy-five and you've
got a deal - a good one.
TRAVIS
How much to get a permit to carry?
ANDY
Well, you're talking big money now.
I'd say at least five grand, maybe
more, and it would take a while to
check it out. The way things are
going now $5.000 is probably low.
You see, I try not to fool with the
small-time crap. Too risky, too little
bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the
permit it'll be as solid as the Empire
State Building.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
Nah, this'll be fine.
ANDY
You can't carry in a cab even with a
permit - so why bother?
TRAVIS
Is there a firing range around?
ANDY
Sure, here, take this card, go to
this place and give 'em the card.
They'll charge you, but there won't
be any hassle.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> pulls out a roll of crisp one hundred dollar bills
and counts off eight.
ANDY
You in Nam? Can't help but notice
your jacket?
TRAVIS
(looking up)
Huh?
ANDY
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket.
Where were you? Bet you got to handle
a lot of weapons out there.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> hands Andy the bills. Andy counts them and gives Travis
a twenty and five.
TRAVIS
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital,
then the next.
ANDY
(through counting)
It's hell out there all right. A
real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this,
though: It's bringing a lot of
fantastic guns. The market's flooded.
Colt automatics are all over.
(pockets the money)
TRAVIS
(intensely)
They'd never get me to go back.
They'd have to shoot me first.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS (CONT'D)
(pause)
You got anything to carry these in?
TRAVIS
(gestures to pistols)
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is like a light switch: For long periods he goes along
dark and silent, saying nothing; then suddenly, the current
is turned on and the air is filled with the electricity of
his personality. <char who="trav">Travis'</char> inner intensity sets Andy back a
bit, but he quickly recovers.
ANDY
Sure.
Andy pulls a gym bag from under his bed. He wraps the gun in
the sheet in the bag and zips it up. An identical gym bag
can be partially seen under the bed. He hands <char who="trav">Travis</char> the
bag.
ANDY
You like ball games?
TRAVIS
Huh?
ANDY
I can get you front and center.
What do you like? I can get you Mets,
Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you
the Mayor's box.
TRAVIS
Nah. I ain't interested.
Andy closes and locks the suitcases.
ANDY
Okay, okay.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> turns to leave.
ANDY
Wait a second, Travis. I'll walk you
out.
CUT TO:
58.
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER. The face of TRAVIS' apartment has
changed. The long, blank wall behind the table is now
covered with tacked-up charts, pictures, newspaperclippings, maps.
CAMERA does not come close enough to discern the exact
contents of these clippings.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is in C.U. in the middle of the floor doing push-ups.
He is bareback, wearing only his jeans. There is a long scar
across his left side.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
May 29, 1972. I must get in shape.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.
Twenty-five push-ups each morning, one hundred sit-ups, one
hundred knee-bends. I have quit smoking.
Travis, still bareback, passes his stiff arm through the
flame of a gas burner without flinching a muscle.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Total organization is necessary.
Every muscle must be tight.
INT. FIRING RANGE
The CRACKING SOUND of rapid-fire pistol shots fills the musty
air of the firing range. The walls are heavily soundproofed,
and sawdust is spread over the floor.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> stands rock solid, firing the .44 Magnum at an arm's
length. With each blasting discharge from the Magnum, <char who="trav">Travis'</char>
body shudders and shakes, his arm as if each recoil from the
giant gun was a direct attack on his masculinity.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> fires the Magnum as quickly as he can re-set, re-aim
and re-fire. The Magnum is empty, he sets it down, picks up
the .38 Special and begins firing as soon as he can aim.
After the .38, comes the .25: It is as if he were in a contest
to see how quickly he can fire the pistols. After all the
guns are discharged, he begins reloading them without a
moment's hesitation.
Downrange, the red and white targets have the black outline
of a human figure drawn over them. The contour-man convulses
under the steady barrage of <char who="trav">Travis'</char> rapid-fire shots.
59.
INT. APARTMENT
TRAVIS, now wearing an unfastened green plaid western shirt,
sits at the table writing in his diary. The vial of bennies
is on the table.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
My body fights me always. It won't
work, it won't sleep, it won't shit,
it won't eat.
LATER. TRAVIS, his shirt still revealing his bare chest,
sits on his straight-backed chair watching the TV. The .44
Magnum rests on his lap.
The TV is Broadcasting ROCK TIME, a late afternoon local
teenage dance and rock show. On screen YOUNG TEENYBOPPERS
are dancing, and the TV CAMERAMAN, as any devotee of the
genre knows, is relentlessly ZOOMING-IN on their firm young
breasts, fannies and crotches -- a sensibility which reflects
TRAVIS' own. These supper-hour rock dance shows are the most
unabashedly voyeuristic form of broadcasting the medium has
yet developed.
The HARD ROCK NUMBER ends, and the TV CAMERA CUTS TO the
local DISC JOCKEY, a hirsute plastic-looking man about 35.
FIVE scrumptious TEENYBOPPERS are literally hanging on his
shoulders and arms, their faces turned up to him in droolish
awe. Out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc jockey
blather. He is the complete asshole; I don't know who is
currently performing this function in New York, but in Los
Angeles his name is Real Don Steele.
TV DISC JOCKEY
Freshingly, fantastic, freaked-out
dance time. Can you dig it? Dig on
it. You got it, flaunt it.
TRAVIS watches the show, his face hard and unmoving. He is,
as the Scriptures would say, pondering all these things in
his heart. Why is it the assholes get all the beautiful young
chicks? He takes a swig of peach brandy.
CUT TO:
EARLY EVENING, about 6:30 p.m. TRAVIS' taxi, with 'Off
Duty' light on, sits near the curb somewhere in midtown
Manhattan.
TRAVIS runs his hand down the left side of his jacket,
attempting to smooth out the bulge underneath.
(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS opens his jacket partially, checking underneath.
There rests the nickel-plated .38 Special in its holster.
P.O.V. down the street where TRAVIS' taxi is parked: Several
blocks ahead the red, white and blue campaign headquarters
of CHARLES PALANTINE are visible.
TRAVIS' eyes resume their watch.
TRAVIS starts the car and drives toward the PALANTINE
HEADQUARTERS.
TRACKING P.O.V. shot of row of storefronts leading up to
Palantine Headquarters. P.O.V. passes headquarters: it is
half-empty. A few stalwart SUPPORTERS continue to work toward
the rear of the office. BETSY'S desk ----
Sign in window reads: "Only 4 More Days Until Arrival of
CHARLES PALANTINE."
TRAVIS' "Off Duty" light goes off as he speeds up and heads
toward a prospective fare.
LATER THAT NIGHT, about 9:30. UPTOWN -- 128th and
Amsterdam. The Jungle. TRAVIS' taxi pulls up to an
address, lets off YOUNG BLACK MAN.
TRAVIS receives fare and tip, takes off.
P.O.V. as TRAVIS works his way through Harlem back down
Seventh Ave. Cluster of YOUNG BLACK STREET PUNKS pretend to
hail cab -- we ignore them. One throws wine bottle which
crashes in our path -- taxi swerves to avoid it.
CAMERA TRACKS through sidewalk CROWDS with the roving,
suspicious, antagonistic eye of a taxi-driver.
LATER THAT NIGHT, about 12:30. TRAVIS is on the LOWER EAST
SIDE, somewhere on B Street, east of Tompkins Square.
The sidewalks are populated with the remains of what once
was the hippie movement: TEENAGE STREET-WALKERS, JUNKIES,
THUGS, emaciated LONERS on the prowl.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls over, letting out a fare.
TRAVIS pockets his fare, but the rear right door doesn't
slam -- instead there is the SOUND of another person jumping
into the cab.
TRAVIS checks the back seat in the rear-view mirror: there
sits a pale HIPPIE PROSTITUTE.
(CONTINUED)
61.
CONTINUED:
The GIRL is, at best, 14 or 15, although she has been made
up to look older. She wears floppy, Janis Joplin clothes.
Her face is pallid. She wears large blue-tinted sunglasses
and multi-colored leg stockings.
Her name, as we shall learn later, is IRIS.
TRAVIS hesitates, looking at her in the mirror.
IRIS
Come on, mister, let's get outta
here -- quick.
TRAVIS moves to activate the meter, when the rear door opens.
IRIS is helped out of the cab by a MAN TRAVIS cannot see.
SPORT
(to IRIS)
Come on, baby, let's go. This is
all a real drag.
IRIS lets herself be taken out of the cab. The rear door
closes.
Sport leans partially in the front window, throwing something
on the front seat. TRAVIS looks: it is a crumpled $20 bill.
SPORT
Just forget all about this, cabbie.
It's nothing.
TRAVIS cannot see the Sport's face lime green completely,
but notices he is wearing a jacket. The voice is that of a
man in his early twenties.
TRAVIS turns to catch a glimpse of Sport as he walks off
with Iris.
TRAVIS shrugs and turns around.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls away.
CUT TO:
EARLY MORNING, 6:00 a.m. Quitting time -- TRAVIS pulls into
TAXI GARAGE.
INT. GARAGE
TRAVIS pulls into his stall.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS sits in driver's seat, thinking a moment. He looks
to his right: the crumpled $20 bill still lies there,
untouched since it was thrown there six hours previously.
TRAVIS reluctantly picks up the $20 bill and stuffs it into
his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab. He gathers up
his time report and heads toward book-in table.
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS is walking down the sidewalk
near the taxi garage. His hands are in his jacket pockets,
obscuring the slight bulge on his left side.
TRAVIS turns into the box offfice of PORNO THEATER. He
reaches into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and
pulls out crumpled $20 bill. Seeing the $20 bill, he decides
not to use it, and pays for ticket out of his wallet instead.
TRAVIS walks past concession stand en route to the darkened
theater auditorium. A YOUNG MAN is now sitting listlessly
behind the concessions counter.
INT. PORNO THEATER AUDITORIUM
TRAVIS slouches down into his seat, his face glowing in the
reflected light from the screen.
FEMALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.)
Oh, come on, now, down, lick it,
come on...
(a beat)
Mmm, that's good. Ahh, ahh, more
...
TRAVIS averts his eyes as the action on screen becomes too
graphic. Placing his stiffened right hand beside his eyes,
TRAVIS can, by turning it inward, shut off or open up his
field of vision by small degrees.
MOVIE VOICE DIMINISHES, replaced by SOUND of TRAVIS' voice
over.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
The idea had been growing in my
brain...
CUT TO:
TRACKING SHOT to wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT. CAMERA MOVES
slowly across wall covered with clippings, notes, maps,
pictures. We now see their contents clearly:
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
The wall is covered with CHARLES PALANTINE political
paraphernalia; there are pictures of him, newspaper articles,
leaflets, bumper stickers. As the CAMERA MOVES along it
discovers a sketch of Plaza Hotel, Kennedy Airport and cutup sections of city maps with notations written in. There
is lengthy N.Y. Times clipping detailing the increased Secret
Security Protection during the primaries. A section
pertaining to PALANTINE is underlined. Further along there
is a sheet reading "traveling schedule" and a calendar for
June with finely written notations written over the dates.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
... for some time. True Force.
All the king's men cannot put it
back together again.
As the CAMERA reaches the end of its track, it finds TRAVIS,
standing, his shirt open, but the mattress. He is wearing
the empty holster, and the .44 is in his hand.
In the SHOTS that follow TRAVIS gives the audience a lesson
in gunmanship:
TRAVIS practices fast-drawing the .38 Special from his holster
and firing it.
He hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices
withdrawing it. He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length,
tightening his forearm muscles.
He has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his
inner forearm, whereby the Colt .25 can rest hidden behind
the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated,
sending the .25 flying down the gliders into his palm. He
has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism and
now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden.
He straps an Army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit
in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly.
He now tries on various combinations of shirts, sweater and
jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide
all the handguns he wishes to carry. Finally, wearing two
western shirts, a sweater and jacket, he manages to obscure
the location of all three guns, although he resembles a hunter
bundled up against the Arctic winter.
He sits at the table dum-dumming the .44 bullets -- cutting
"x's" across the bullet heads.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
P.O.V.: he scans the objects of his room through the scope
of the .38.
TRAVIS stands in the middle of his apartment, staring at his
PALANTINE wall. His eyes are glazed with introspection; he
sees nothing but himself.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Listen you screwheads: Here is a
man...
TRAVIS lies on his mattress, all bundled up in his shirts,
sweater, jacket and guns. His face is turned toward the
ceiling, but his eyes are closed. Although the room is
flooded with light, he is finally catching some sleep.
The big furry animal drifts into his own world.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
... who wouldn't take it any more, a
man who stood up against the scum,
the cunts, the dogs, the filth.
Here is ...
(voice trails off)
C.U. of diary: entry ends with words
"Here is" followed by erratic series
of dots.
CUT TO:
NIGHT: the taxis are roaming the slick streets.
Sometimes after 2:00 a.m., TRAVIS pulls his cab to the curb
near an all-night delicatessen in Spanish Harlem. The streets
are relatively deserted.
TRAVIS waves to STOREKEEPER as he walks past counter:
TRAVIS
Hey 'Melio.
Spanish rhythm and blues blares from a cheap radio.
TRAVIS walks over to dairy counter in rear of store, picks
out a pint of chocolate milk, goes over to the open cooler
and picks through various chilled prepackaged sandwiches.
He overhears a VOICE as he looks at the sandwiches.
When TRAVIS returns to the counter with the chocolate milk
and a sandwich in one hand, he sees a YOUNG BLACK MAN holding
a gun on 'Melio.
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
The STICK-UP MAN is nervous, hopped-up, or both; he bounces
on the balls of his cheap worn black tennis shoes -- a strungout junkie on a desperation ride. The STICK-UP MAN, a
thorough unprofessional, doesn't notice TRAVIS.
'MELIO watches the STICK-UP MAN closely, deciding what to do
himself.
STICK-UP MAN
(shaking gun)
Come on, man. Quick, quick, quick.
Hand over that bread.
It doesn't take TRAVIS long to decide what to do: without
hesitation he pulls his .32 from his jacket pocket.
TRAVIS
Hey dude!
The STICK-UP MAN, surprised, turns toward TRAVIS, finding
only an exploding .32. The MAN's lower jaw bursts open with
blood as he reels and crashes to the floor. There is no
emotion on TRAVIS' face.
As the STICK-UP MAN falls, 'MELIO leans over the counter,
wielding his battered .38. He is about to fire when he
realizes the MAN is already dead.
'MELIO, charged up, turns his gun toward TRAVIS, then,
realizing the danger is over, lowers it again.
'MELIO
Thanks, man. Figured I'd get him on
the way out.
TRAVIS sets his .32 on the counter.
TRAVIS
You're gonna have to cover me on
this one, 'Melio. I can't stay for
the cop show.
'MELIO
You can't do that, Travis. You're
my witness.
TRAVIS
The hell I can't. It's no sweat for
you. What is this for you, number
five?
'MELIO smiles and holds up four fingers:
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
'MELIO
No, only four.
(shrug)
Alright, Travis, I'll do what I can.
TRAVIS
Thanks a lot.
TRAVIS exits. 'MELIO picks up the phone and starts dialing.
The bloody BODY lies on the floor unmoving.
TRAVIS, still carrying his pint of chocolate milk and
sandwich, walks down the empty sidewalk and enters his cab.
The street is deserted.
CUT TO:
DIRECT CUT TO PORNOGRAPHIC MOVIE: this is the first time we
have actually seen the porno movie itself.
SEVERAL ACTORS and ACTRESSES are dallying on screen in
whatever manner the ratings board deems permissible.
Whatever the action, the movie's decor is strictly Zody's --
ersatz landscape paintings, tufted bedspreads. As in most
porno films, the ACTORS look up occasionally toward the CAMERA
to receive instructions. Studio grunts, groans and moans of
pleasure have been dubbed in.
Action on screen begins to go into SLOW MOTION, the ACTORS
and ACTRESSES gradually transforming obscenity into poetry.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS, sitting in his chair in his APARTMENT, watching
afternoon soap opera. He is cleaning his .38 and eating
from a jar of applesauce. Soap opera audio continues.
He watches the soap opera without expression.
SOUND TRACK of film also SLOWS DOWN, gradually mixing with
and then becoming the sound track of a midafternoon TV soap
opera.
A YOUNG GIRL and BOY are talking in those familiar soap opera
voices and a third party, the GIRL's mother, who had tried
to terminate their "relationship."
CUT TO:
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
TELEVISION: The BOY is visiting the GIRL in her hospital
room. Both look as if they've stepped out of the Blue Chip
stamp catalogue.
SOAP OPERA BOY
Is it that she just doesn't -- like
me?
SOAP OPERA GIRL
(hesitantly)
Well, Jim, it's just that -- I don't
know how to say this -- it's that
she thinks your parents aren't...
good enough, I guess.
TRAVIS, through cleaning his gun, begins to play a game with
the television set.
He places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon crate
which supports the TV. Then, slowly rocking his heel back
and forth, he sees how far he can tip the melon crate without
knocking it over.
The TV, still broadcasting the hospital room melodrama, rocks
back and forth.
TRAVIS pushes the TV farther and farther until finally the
inevitable happens -- the crate tips backward, sending the
portable TV crashing to the floor.
There is a short flash and the TV screen turns white.
TRAVIS, realizing what he has done, bends over, turns the TV
upright on the floor, fiddles with the knobs, slaps it, and
tries to reactivate the vanished image. TRAVIS' efforts are
futile; a tube has broken, and the TV will not come back to
life.
TRAVIS
(to himself)
Damn, damn.
TRAVIS bends over in the chair and places his head in his
hands, despairing of himself.
FADE TO:
About 1 a.m. TRAVIS pulls his cab behind a line of empty
taxis parked outside the Bellmore Cafeteria, a cabbie hangout
on Park Avenue South.
He locks his cab and walks past the line of taxis. He
sidesteps TWO DRUNKEN FIGHTING BUMS and enters the Bellmore.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
A LOUD BUZZER RINGS as TRAVIS steps INTO THE BELLMORE. He
pulls a ticket from the dispenser (silencing the buzzer) and
walks toward the wall-length counter.
An assortment of CABBIES are seated around a formica-topped
table near the rear of the cafeteria. Some are barely awake,
some are eating, the rest are swapping stories and smalltalk.
Wizard, Dough-Boy, Charlie T and a FOURTH CABBIE are seated
at a long table.
WIZARD
You know Eddie, he's the new hippie
kid in our group, long hair...
Wizard demonstrates length of hair and others nod.
WIZARD
...he called up the Dispatcher last
night. Charlie McCall, our
dispatcher...
DOUGH-BOY
One-Ball McCall?
WIZARD
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up
and says, "Hey, what do you want me
to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep.
I got a girl in the back and she
doesn't have the fare. She wants me
to come in back and collect.
What should I do?
The cabbies laugh. Across the cafeteria <char who="trav">Travis</char> selects a
cup of coffee and some pastries.
CHARLIE T
This is on the two-way with about a
hundred and fifty cars listenin in.
WIZARD
McCall says. "How much on the meter?"
Eddie comes back and says "Two-fifty."
McCall says, "Is she worth it".
More laughter.
DOUGH-BOY
Fuckin One-Ball.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
WIZARD
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about
19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What
can I tell you?"
FOURTH CABBIE
She should have told him to get an
OK from the front office.
(laughter)
WIZARD
McCall says, "Well, if you want some
help I'll see if I can send some
units out."
CHARLIE T
Yeah. About a hundred and fifty.
DOUGH-BOY
I hope he had a checker.
WIZARD
She was just a kid. Stoned, you
know.
Travis, carrying his coffee and pastries, walks over to their
table. Charlie T spots him.
CHARLIE T
Hiya Killer.
Charlie forms his hand into a pistol, cocks and fires, making
the SOUND, "Pgghew." TRAVIS nods.
WIZARD
You're getting a rep, Travis.
TRAVIS sits down and the other CABBIES resume their
conversation.
CHARLIE T
Got the five you owe me, Killer?
TRAVIS reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of small
denomination bills. The crumpled $20 bill falls onto the
table. TRAVIS stares at it a moment. He unfolds a five,
gives it to CHARLIE T, then picks up the crumpled $20 and
puts it back into his jacket pocket.
WIZARD (O.S.)
(to Travis)
What's the action around?
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
Slow.
CHARLIE T
Shit yes. Night woulda been dead if
I hadn't grabbed an outatowner at
Kennedy. Took him roun the horn and
got a five dollar tip to boot.
WIZARD
(joking)
One of these days we're gonna turn
you in, Charlie T. Fleecin the hicks
like that.
DOUGH-BOY
Remember the time this cat picks up
four dudes from the other side,
Pakastanis I think they were, holds
up their passports, to the toll booth
collector on the bridge and charges
em ten bucks each for 'crossing the
border?
They all laugh.
CHARLIE T
Hell, I know'd you to do worse.
DOUGH-BOY
Least I'm no airport rat. I work
the whole town.
CHARLIE T
(chuckling)
It's a living.
WIZARD gets up to leave.
WIZARD
Well, I'm shovin' on.
WIZARD gets up, nods and walks toward the CASHIER. After a
second's thought, TRAVIS calls to him:
TRAVIS
Hey Wiz, just a second. I wanna
talk to you.
WIZARD waits for TRAVIS as he takes a final gulp of coffee
and catches up with him. CHARLIE T calls to TRAVIS as they
go:
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
CHARLIE T
See ya, Killer. Don't forget your
pea shooter.
CHARLIE T cocks his imaginary gun again, fires and chuckles.
WIZARD and TRAVIS nod goodbye, pay the CASHIER and exit.
EXT.
TRAVIS follows WIZARD out onto the sidewalk. TRAVIS follows
WIZARD as he walks toward his cab. He has something on his
mind, something he wants to talk to WIZARD about.
TRAVIS
(walking)
Hey Wiz.
WIZARD leans back against the cab. TRAVIS is about to speak
when he spots a GROUP of BLACK and PUERTO RICAN STREET PUNKS,
ages 12-15, jiving down the sidewalk toward him. ONE tosses
a spray paint can around his back, basketball style.
ANOTHER mocks as if he's going to scratch a key along one of
the cabs.
WIZARD has no visible reaction. A flash of controlled anger
crosses TRAVIS' face. He stares at the BOY with the poised
key. It is the same look that crossed his face in the Harlem
Deli. We are reminded with a jolt that the killer lies just
beneath TRAVIS' surface.
The BLACK PUNK must instinctively realize this too, because
he makes a cocky show of putting the key back into his pocket
and be-bopping around TRAVIS and WIZARD.
The YOUNG MEAN-STREETERS continue down the street and TRAVIS
turns back to WIZARD.
Across the street, in the background, a JUNKIE nestles in a
doorway.
TRAVIS
(hesitant)
Wiz?
WIZARD
Yeah?
TRAVIS
Look, ah, we never talked much, you
and me...
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
WIZARD
Yeah?
TRAVIS
I wanted to ask you something, on
account you've been around so long.
WIZARD
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard
for nothing.
TRAVIS
Well, I just, you know...
WIZARD
Things got ya down?
TRAVIS
Real down.
WIZARD
It happens.
TRAVIS
Sometimes it gets so I just don't
know what I'm gonna do. I get some
real crazy ideas, you know? Just go
out and do somethin.
WIZARD
The taxi life, you mean.
TRAVIS
Yeah.
WIZARD
(nods)
I know.
TRAVIS
Like do anything, you know.
WIZARD
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me
explain. You choose a certain way
of life. You live it. It becomes
what you are. I've been a hack 27
years, the last ten at night.
Still don't own my own cab. I guess
that's the way I want it. You see,
that must be what I am.
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
A police car stops across the street. TWO PATROLMEN get out
and roust the JUNKIE from his doorway.
WIZARD
(continuing)
Look, a person does a certain thing
and that's all there is to it. It
becomes what he is. Why fight it?
What do you know? How long you been
a hack, a couple months? You're
like a peg and you get dropped into
a slot and you got to squirm and
wiggle around a while until you fit
in.
TRAVIS
(pause)
That's just about the dumbest thing
I ever heard, Wizard.
WIZARD
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell?
I've been a cabbie all my life, what
do I know?
(a beat)
I don't even know what you're talking
about.
TRAVIS
Neither do I, I guess.
WIZARD
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough
at first. But you fit in. You got
no choice.
WIZARD
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
WIZARD
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all
right.
(a beat)
I seen enough to know.
TRAVIS
Thanks.
WIZARD gives TRAVIS a short wave implying, "Chin up, old
boy," and walks around to the driver's side of his cab.
(CONTINUED)
74.

WIZARD drives off, leaving the street to its natural
inhabitants.
CUT TO:
FADE IN:
EXT. CHARLES PALANTINE RALLY - DAY
A rally platform in a supermarket parking lot somewhere in
QUEENS is draped in red, white and blue bunting.
A CROWD of about 500 persons mills about, waiting for the
rally to begin. Piped pop-country MUSIC plays over the
loudspeaker system.
The CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, with their distinctive
metallic grey suits, sun glasses and football physiques,
stands out in the CROWD.
On the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of LOCAL POLITICOS
as well as some PALANTINE WORKERS and ADVISERS.
TOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY
stands on the platform steps talking with ANOTHER WORKER.
TOM looks up and to his left for a moment, then returns to
what he was reading. Then he returns his gaze to the upper
left, watching something very closely.
After a moment he walks over to the steps where BETSY is
standing.
TOM
Betsy, come over here a moment.
BETSY
What is it? I'm busy.
TOM
(insistent)
Just follow me.
BETSY excuses herself and walks across the platform with
TOM.
As they stand to the rear of the platform, TOM secretively
makes a gesture with his eyes and says out of the side of
his mouth:
TOM
Look there.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:
TOM (CONT'D)
(her eyes follow his)
No, over further - get your glasses -
yes, over there. Isn't that little
guy the same guy that was bugging
you around the office about a month
ago?
BETSY, putting on her glasses, looks closely. She tries not
to make her stare too obvious.
BETSY
No, I don't think so.
(a beat)
That's someone else.
TOM
Now look more closely. Look around
the eyes and chin. See? See there?
CAMERA CLOSES IN on <char who="trav">TRAVIS BICKLE</char> standing in the CROWD: he
has shaved his head to a short stubble. There he is: brushcut, wearing a giant grin, and a large "Palantine '72" button.
Although it is a pleasant sunny day, TRAVIS wears a bulky
bulged-out Army jacket.
TRAVIS looks warily from side to side and vanishes in the
CROWD.
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS walks up to a SECRET SERVICE MAN
standing near the fringes of the CROWD. The SECRET SERVICE
MAN -- in sun glasses, grey suit, ever-roving eyes -- is
immediately identifiable.
Whenever TRAVIS confronts a symbol of authority, he becomes
like a young boy. This time is no exception, although one
suspects there is a plan hatching beneath that boyish
exterior. The SECRET SERVICE MAN, for his part, is about as
talkative as the Sphinx.
TRAVIS
Are you a Secret Service Man?
SECRET SERVICE MAN
(indifferently)
Why do you ask?
TRAVIS
I've seen a lot of suspicious
looking people around here today.
SECRET SERVICE MAN glances at TRAVIS momentarily.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Who?
TRAVIS
Oh, lots. I don't know where they
all are now. There used to be one
standing over there.
(points)
SECRET SERVICE MAN's gaze follows TRAVIS' finger for a second,
then return to TRAVIS.
TRAVIS
Is it hard to get to be a Secret
Service Man?
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Why?
TRAVIS
I kinda thought I might make a good
one. I'm very observant.
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Oh?
TRAVIS
I was in the Army too.
(beat)
And I'm good with crowds.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN is starting to get interested in
TRAVIS: he definitely ranks as a suspicious character.
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Is that so?
TRAVIS
What kind of guns do you guys use?
.38's?
The SECRET SERVICE MAN decides it's time to get some more
information on TRAVIS:
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Look, um, if you give me your name
and address, we'll send you the
information on how to apply.
TRAVIS
You would, huh?
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
SECRET SERVICE MAN
(taking out notepad)
Sure.
TRAVIS
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's
with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live
at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn,
New Jersey. Zip code 07410.
(a beat)
Got that?
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll
send you all the stuff all right.
TRAVIS
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN motions to a SECRET SERVICE
PHOTOGRAPHER to catch a picture of TRAVIS. TRAVIS notices
this, and quickly slips away into the CROWD.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS sits at his desk in his APARTMENT, writing. He wears
jeans, western shirt and empty holster.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
June 11. Eight rallies in six more
days. The time is coming.
CUT TO:
NIGHT. TRAVIS' taxi picks up a FARE in the midtown area and
heads downtown.
LOWER EAST SIDE. TRAVIS lets off FARE on B Street and cuts
across toward Tompkins Square.
TRAVIS turns the corner when SKREETCH! he suddenly hits the
brakes, causing the cab to rock back and forth.
He has almost hit a YOUNG GIRL recklessly crossing the street.
She thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her balance
and stares in shock through the front window. C.U. GIRL's
face.
TRAVIS recognizes her face: it's IRIS, the GIRL in his taxi
a week or so before. IRIS looks at TRAVIS sharply then turns
and continues walking.
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS' eyes follow her and she rejoins a GIRLFRIEND. They
are both dressed as hippie hookers: sloppy clothes, boots,
jeans, floppy hats. And the old come-hither walk is
unmistakable.
TRAVIS follows IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND slowly as they walk
down the sidewalk.
TRAVIS' P.O.V. He examines them from bottom to top -- boots,
legs, thighs, breasts, faces, hats.
As TRAVIS rolls astride the GIRLS, he notices the familiar
FRINGE OF A SUEDE JACKET standing in the shadows. The GIRLS
look toward the SHADOWED FIGURE, smile, acknowledge some
unheard comment, and continue on.
IRIS looks back uneasily at TRAVIS' taxi and continues on.
On the corner stand TWO well-to-do COLLEGE STUDENTS, somewhat
out of place in this environment, but making every attempt
to groove on it. They are high on something or another.
The GIRLS spot the COLLEGE STUDENTS and walk over to them.
They exchange some small talk and walk off together. There
is little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick-up.
TRAVIS must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to
continue following the GIRLS and their COLLEGIATE JOHNS.
This is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy.
As TRAVIS slows down to make the turn, he notices ANOTHER
HIPPIE HOOKER who had been watching him watching IRIS and
her GIRLFRIEND. She walks over to the taxi, loans in the
open left front window and gives TRAVIS the come-on disguised
as an innocent question:
C.U. HIPPIE HOOKER.
HIPPIE HOOKER
Hey cabbie! You comin' or goin'?
TRAVIS quickly turns his face away from her in a combination
of shock, embarrassment and revulsion. He is the child caught
with his hand in the cookie jar. The very presence of this
crassly, openly sexual human being frightens and sickens
him.
TRAVIS takes off with a skreetch. His taxi shoots down the
block.
CUT TO:
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
A HOT JUNE DAY. TRAVIS' taxi, the "Off Duty" sign on, is
parked against the curb somewhere in HARLEM. WHITE COPS,
SECRET SERVICE MEN and REPORTERS, punctuate the otherwise
BLACK CROWDS which walk to and fro in the b.g.
CHARLES PALANTINE's voice can be heard coming from a distant
loudspeaker system. It is a political rally.
TRAVIS sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in
the distance. His hair, of course, is still clipped short
and he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses. Even though a
drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, TRAVIS wears
his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side -- the .38
Smith and Wesson bulge.
A BLOCK AWAY, PALANTINE stands on a platform outside his
uptown campaign headquarters. On the platform sit an array
of BLACK DIGNITARIES. Nearby we recognize the SECRET SERVICE
MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans the CROWD
anxiously.
PALANTINE is speaking animatedly. He is an excellent speaker
and captures our attention. He drives hard toward his
arguments, crashes down on his points. His strained voice
rings with sincerity and anger.
C.U. of PALANTINE as he speaks. He is dressed in rolled-up
shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face.
PALANTINE
The time has come to put an end to
the things that divide us: racism,
poverty, way -- and to those
persons who seek to divide us.
Never have I seen such a group of
high officials from the President to
Senate leaders to Cabinet members...
CUT TO TRAVIS: no expression. PALANTINE's words are barely
distinguishable from a block away:
PALANTINE
(in distance)
... pit black against white, young
against old, sow anger, disunity and
suspicion -- and all in the name of
the "good of the country."
Well, their game is over.
(applause)
All their games are over.
