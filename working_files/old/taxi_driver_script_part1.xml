<openQuote>"The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief

is the central and inevitable fact of human existence."
<person>THOMAS WOLFE</person>,
    "God's Lonely Man"</openQuote>
<intro><narr><char who="trav">TRAVIS BICKLE</char>, age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner. On
the surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a
quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from
nowhere, lighting up his whole face. But behind that smile,
around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the
ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness
and loneliness. He seems to have wandered in from a land
where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants
seldom speak. The head moves, the expression changes, but
the eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> is now drifting in and out of the New York City night
life, a dark shadow among darker shadows. Not noticed, no
reason to be noticed, <char who="trav">Travis</char> is one with his surroundings.
He wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt
and a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, "King
Kong Company 1968-70".
He has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex,
lonely sex, but sex nonetheless. He is a raw male force,
driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. Then one looks
closer and sees the evitable. The clock sprig cannot be wound
continually tighter. As the earth moves toward the sun, Travis
Bickle moves toward violence.</narr></intro>
<scene num="1"><narr>FILM OPENS on EXT. of MANHATTAN CAB GARAGE. Weather-beaten
sign above driveway reads, "Taxi Enter Here". Yellow cabs
scuttle in and out. It is WINTER, snow is piled on the
curbs, the wind is howling.
INSIDE GARAGE are parked row upon row of multi-colored taxis.
Echoing SOUNDS of cabs idling, cabbies talking. Steamy breath
and exhaust fill the air.

SOUND of office busywork: shuffling, typing, arguing.
PERSONAL OFFICE is a cluttered disarray. Sheets with heading

CUT IN to ongoing conversation between the middle-aged
PERSONNEL OFFICER and a YOUNG MAN standing in front on his
desk.
The young man is <char who="trav">TRAVIS BICKLE</char>. He wears his jeans, boots
and Army jacket. He takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette.
The PERSONNEL OFFICER is beat and exhausted: he arrives at
work exhausted. TRAVIS is something else again. His intense
steely gaze is enough to jar even the PERSONNEL OFFICER out
of his workaday boredom.</narr>

<narr>CREDITS appear over scenes from MANHATTAN NIGHTLIFE. The
snow has melted, it is spring.
A rainy, slick, wet miserable night in Manhattan's theatre
district.
Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well-dressed
pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. The
high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows
are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the
poor and common is also falling on them.
The unremitting SOUNDS of HONKING and SHOUTING play against
the dull pitter-patter of rain. The glare of yellow, red and
green lights reflects off the pavements and autos.
"When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" -
so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular
night's activity. Only the taxis seem to rise above the
situation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and
traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please.
Further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so
glittering. The rain also falls on the street bums and aged
poor. Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners,
hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. And the taxis service
them too.
All through the CREDITS the exterior sounds are muted, as if
coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner.
The listener is at a safe but privileged distance.
After examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife, CAMERA
begins to CLOSE IN on one particular taxi, and it is assumed
that this taxi is being driven by <char>TRAVIS BICKLE</char>.</narr>
END CREDITS</scene>
<scene num="3"><narr>CUT TO:
<char who="trav">Travis'</char>s yellow taxi pulls in foreground. On left rear door
are lettered the words "Dependable Taxi Service".
We are somewhere on the upper fifties on Fifth Ave. The rain
has not let up.
An ELDERLY WOMAN climbs in the right rear door, crushing her
umbrella. <char who="trav">Travis</char> waits a moment, then pulls away from the
curb with a start.

Later, we see <char who="trav">Travis'</char> taxi speeding down the rain-slicked

<narr>On seat next to TRAVIS is half-eaten cheeseburger and order

answers:</narr>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS
Why should it be grounded?</d>
<d who="man">MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
Listen - I mean I just saw the needle

You can't see it for the fog!</d>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.</d>

CUT TO:
<narr>TRAVIS' APARTMENT. CAMERA PANS SILENTLY across INT. room,
indicating this is not a new scene.
TRAVIS is sitting at plain table writing. He wears shirt,
jeans, boots. An unfiltered cigarette rests in a bent coffee
can ash tray.</narr>
<narr>CLOSE UP of notebook. It is a plain lined dimestore notebook
and the words TRAVIS is writing with a stubby pencil are
those he is saying. The columns are straight, disciplined.
Some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink. The handwriting
is jagged.</narr>
<narr>CAMERA continues to PAN, examining TRAVIS' apartment. It is
unusual, to say the least:
A ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall. The floor
is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets
maps and pornography. The pornography is of the sort that
looks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos
of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and
clothesline. There is no furniture other than the rickety
chair and table. A beat-up portable TV rests on an upright
melon crate. The red silk mass in another corner looks like
a Vietnamese flag. Indecipherable words, figures, numbers
are scribbled on the plain plaster walls. Ragged black wires
dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung.</narr>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS (V.O.)
They're all animals anyway. All the
animals come out at night: Whores,
skunk pussies, buggers, queens,
fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal.
<desc par="beat">(a beat)</desc>
Someday a real rain will come and
wash all this scum off the streets.</d>

<narr>It's EARLY MORNING: 6 a.m. The air is clean and fresh and
the streets nearly deserted.

<d who="trav">TRAVIS (V.O.)
Each night when I return the cab to

<narr>INT. of TAXI GARAGE. TRAVIS pulls his taxi into garage
stall. <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> reaches across the cab and extracts a small
vial of bennies from the glove compartment.
TRAVIS stands next to the cab, straightens his back, and
tucks the bottle of pills into his jacket pocket. He lowers
his head, looks into back seat, opens rear door and bends
inside.
He shakes a cigarette out of his pack of camels and lights
it.</narr>
<narr>SLIGHT TIMECUT: <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> books it at garage office. Old, rotting
slabs of wood are screwed to a grey crumbling
concrete wall. Each available space is covered with handlettered signs, time schedules, check-out sheets, memos. The
signs read:

<narr>OUTSIDE, TRAVIS walks pleasantly down Broadway, his hands in
his jacket pockets. The sidewalks are deserted, except for
diligent fruit and vegetable VENDORS setting up their stalls.
He takes a deep breath of fresh air, pulls a white pill from
his pocket, pops it into his mouth.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> turns a corner, keeps walking. Ahead of him is a 24-
hour PORNO THEATRE. The theatre, a blaze of cheap day-glow
reds and yellows, is an offense to the clear, crisp morning
air. The permanent lettering reads, "Adam Theatre, 16mm
Sound Features". Underneath, today's feature are handlettered: "Six-Day Cruise" and "Beaver Dam".
<char who="trav">Travis</char> stops at the box office, purchases a ticket, and walks

A variety of YOUNG WORKERS joke and chatter as they labor
through stacks of papers. The room is pierced with the sound
of ringing phones.
Seen from a distance - the only way <char who="trav">Travis</char> can see them -
those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, wellgroomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields
of Massachusetts and Connecticut.
CAMERA FAVORS <char who="bets">BETSY</char>, about 25, an extremely attractive woman
sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several
stacks of papers. Her attractions, however, are more than
skin deep. Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen,
though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every
man who passes her desk as her mind computes his desirability:
Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional, material. Simple
pose and status do not impress her; she seeks out the
extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in other words, starfucker of the highest order.
Betsy, putting down the phone, calls <char who="tom">TOM</char>, a lanky, amiable
and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk:</narr>
<d who="bets">BETSY
Tom.</d>
<narr>Tom is pleasant and good-looking, but lacks those special

It is 3:30 IN THE MORNING in a bacon-shaped all night WEST
SIDE REATAURANT. The thick smell hangs in the air - fried
grease, smoke, sweat, regurgitated wine.
Whatever doesn't flush away in New York at night turns up in
places like this. A burly grease-stained COOK stands over
the grill. A JUNKIE shuffles from one side of the door to
another. Slouched over the small four-person formica tables
are several WELL-DRESSED BLACKS (too well-dressed for this
time and place), a cluster of STREET PEOPLE and a lost OLD
COOT who hangs onto his cup of coffee as if it were his last
possession.
The restaurant, brightly lit, perfectly conveys the image
urban plasticity - without the slightest hint of an
accompanying cleanliness.
Toward the rear of the restaurant sit three cabbies: WIZARD,
a worn man about fifty, <char who="db">DOUGH-BOY</char>, younger family man, <char who="char">CHARLIE
T.</char>, fourtyish Black.
<char who="wiz">Wizard</char> is telling <char who="db">Dough-Boy</char> a story. <char who="char">Charlie T.</char>, his elbows
popped against table top, is not listening. He stares silently
down at a plate of cold scrambled eggs and a Racing Forum.
His eyes may not be open.</narr>
<char who="wiz">WIZARD
First she did her make-up. You know,
I hate it when they do that.
I mean she does the whole works, the

the rouge...</char>

Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.

Oh, yeah. People will do anything in

anything. People too cheap to rent a
hotel room, people scoring dope,
people shooting up, people who want
to embarrass you.

<d who="trav">TRAVIS
I know. I could have picked you up.</d>
<d who="bets">BETSY
Huh?</d>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS
Late one night. About three. At the
plaza.</d>
<d who="bets">BETSY
Three in the morning? I don't think
so. I have to go to bed early. I
work days. It must have been somebody
else.</d>

You're right! Now I remember! It was
after the Western regional planners
were in town and the meeting went
late. The next day I was completely
bushed. It was unbelievable.</d>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS
If it wasn't for a drunk I would
have picked you up. He wanted to go
to the DMZ.</d>
<d who="bets">BETSY
The DMZ?</d>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to
ditch him, but he was already in the
cab, so I had to take him. That's
the law. Otherwise I would have picked
you up.</d>
<d who="bets">BETSY
That would have been quite a
coincidence.</d>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS
You'd be surprised how often you see
the same people, get the same fare.
People have patterns. They do more
or less the same things every day. I
can tell.</d>
<d who="bets">BETSY
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every
night.</d>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary
people. A guy I know - <char who="db">Dough-Boy</char> -
met his wife that way. They got to
talking. She said she usually caught
the bus so he started picking her up
at the bus stop, taking her home
with the flag up.</d>

Lengthy POV SHOT from <char who="trav">Travis'</char> vantage point behind the wheel.
We see the city as <char who="trav">Travis</char> sees it. The front windshield is a
little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right
screen. The intercom crackles with STATIC and MESSAGES.
The light turns green; we take off with a start. A short
first gear - quick shift - a long second gear. The cab eases
to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares.
Our eyes scan the long lines of PEDESTRIANS. The regular -
bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies -
they mean nothing now. They only blend into the sidewalks
and lighted storefronts.
Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the
curb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head?
In the next block there are perhaps three, four fares - quick
gas-up through this yellow light - brake sharply - check the
action. The first: Tourist, nickel tipper - let the next guy
pick them up. Let the second go also, the third - there's a
live fare. Middle-aged LOCAL WOMAN: Short fare to the East
Side, good tip.
We pull to the curb, waiting for her to get in. It is a long
wait - a Black STREET WALKER crosses in front of the cab. We
focus on (as <char who="trav">Travis</char> would) a YOUNG COUPLE embracing in the
distance.
As we travel, we hear <char who="trav">Travis'</char> random thoughts about selecting
fares and tips:</narr>
<d who="trav">TRAVIS (V.O.)
You work at night, you get an
instinct. You can smell them. The
big tippers, the stiffs, the trouble
makers. Quarter is good tip for
Manhattan. Queens is better, Brooklyn
is best. go for the guys with
suitcases. The rich are the worst
tippers, hooks are lousy. Spooks
are okay, but they don't live at
Park Ave after all.</d>
<narr>The meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. A
quick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says softly,
"192 East 89". We take off with another jolt. Cross back up
9th Ave, then cut through the park.
We're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we string
together?
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but quickly steps back
again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be a $1.40 fare.
Now through the park and we're almost there. Check the numbers -
134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40.
Check back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quarters
and a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35.
The tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We take
off again with a jolt.
This is <char who="trav">Travis'</char> world: Dark side streets, garish glaring
main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen
instantaneous decisions a minute. Are these people, are these
objects?</narr></scene>
