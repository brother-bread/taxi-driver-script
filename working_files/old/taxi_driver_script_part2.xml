<char who="bets">Betsy</char> has opened the package and is admiring the record -

They approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno
theatre advertising "The Swedish Marriage Manual". The box
office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with
explicit publicity stills. Offending portions have been
blocked out with black tape.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets.

    I bought a couple of tickets.
<speaker v.o.="Speaking, Betsy">BETSY</speaker>
But this is a porno movie.
<speaker v.o.="Speaking, Travis">TRAVIS</speaker>
No, these are the kind that couples
go to. They're not like the other
movies. All kinds of couples go.
Honest. I've seen them.
<narr><char who="trav">Travis</char> seems confused. He is so much part of his own world,
he fails to comprehend another's world. Compared to the movies
he sees, this is respectable. But then there's also something
that <char who="trav">Travis</char> could not even acknowledge, much less admit:
That he really wants to get this pure white girl into that
dark porno theatre.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> makes an awkward gesture to escort <char who="bets">Betsy</char> into the
theatre. <char who="bets">Betsy</char> looks at the tickets, at the theatre, at
<char who="trav">Travis</char>. She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the
turnstile. She thinks to herself: "What the Hell. What can
happen?" She's always been curious about these pictures
anyway, and - like all women, no matter how intelligent -
she's been raised not to offend her date. A perverse logic
which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like
these.
<loc>INSIDE THE THEATER</loc><char who="trav">Travis</char> escorts <char who="bets">Betsy</char> to an empty center row. <char who="trav">Travis</char> was right.
Couples do go to films like this. There are at least six or
seven other <char>MEN</char> with their bewigged <char>"DATES"</char>.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch. <char who="bets">Betsy</char>
looks curiously from side to side.
ON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is
speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in
a happy marriage. Subtitles translate her words. Then,
without warning, there is a direct CUT to a couple copulating
on a sterile table-like bed.
<char who="trav">Travis</char> watches intently. The color, however, is slowly
draining from <char who="bets">Betsy's</char> cheeks. One thought fills her mind:
"What am I doing here?"

<char>SEVERAL ACTORS and ACTRESSES</char> are dallying on screen in

Whatever the action, the movie's decor is strictly Zody's --
ersatz landscape paintings, tufted bedspreads. As in most
porno films, the <char>ACTORS</char> look up occasionally toward the CAMERA
to receive instructions. Studio grunts, groans and moans of
pleasure have been dubbed in.

A HOT JUNE DAY. TRAVIS' taxi, the "Off Duty" sign on, is
parked against the curb somewhere in <loc>HARLEM</loc>. <char>WHITE COPS</char>,
<char>SECRET SERVICE MEN</char> and <char>REPORTERS</char>, punctuate the otherwise
<char>BLACK CROWDS</char> which walk to and fro in the b.g.
<char who="pal">CHARLES PALANTINE's</char> voice can be heard coming from a distant
loudspeaker system. It is a political rally.
<char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in
the distance. His hair, of course, is still clipped short
and he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses. Even though a
drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> wears
his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side -- the .38
Smith and Wesson bulge.
A BLOCK AWAY, <char who="pal">PALANTINE</char> stands on a platform outside his
uptown campaign headquarters. On the platform sit an array
of <char>BLACK DIGNITARIES</char>. Nearby we recognize the <char who="ssman">SECRET SERVICE
MAN</char> <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char> spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans the CROWD
anxiously.
<char who="pal">PALANTINE</char> is speaking animatedly. He is an excellent speaker
and captures our attention. He drives hard toward his
arguments, crashes down on his points. His strained voice
rings with sincerity and anger.
<shotDesc close-up="true">C.U. of <char who="pal">PALANTINE</char> as he speaks.</shotDesc> He is dressed in rolled-up
shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face.</narr>
<speaker v.o.="Speaking, Palantine">PALANTINE</speaker>
The time has come to put an end to
the things that divide us: racism,
poverty, way -- and to those
persons who seek to divide us.
Never have I seen such a group of
high officials from the President to
Senate leaders to Cabinet members...
<narr>CUT TO <char who="trav">TRAVIS</char>: no expression. <char who="pal">PALANTINE's</char> words are barely
distinguishable from a block away:</narr>
<speaker v.o.="Speaking, Palantine">PALANTINE</speaker>
<par desc="in distance">(in distance)</par>
... pit black against white, young
against old, sow anger, disunity and
suspicion -- and all in the name of
the "good of the country."
Well, their game is over.
<par action="applause">(applause)</par>
All their games are over.
