PALANTINE (CONT'D)
Now is the time to stand up against
such foolishness, propaganda and
demagoguery. Now is the time for
one man to stand up and accept his
neighbor, for one man to give in
order that all might receive. Is
unity and love of common good such a
lost thing?
ALL LIVE SOUND CEASES as TRAVIS' narration begins. He is
reading from a letter or card he has just written.
As he speaks we see SHOTS of PALANTINE speaking, a seated
row of YOUNG BLACK PALANTINE red, white and blue bedecked
CHEERLEADERS, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS examining the CROWD and
so forth. These SHOTS have no direct relationship to the
narration.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
(reading)
Dear Father and Mother, June is the
month, I remember, which brings not
only your wedding anniversary, but
also Father's Day and Mother's
birthday. I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact dates, but I hope this
card will take care of all of them.
I'm sorry I again can not send you
my address like I promised to last
year, but the sensitive nature of my
work for the Army demands utmost
secrecy. I know you will understand.
I am healthy and well and making
lots of money. I have been going
with a girl for several months and I
know you would be proud if you could
see her. Her name is Betsy, but I
can tell you no more than that.
(interrupted)
As TRAVIS reads third paragraph, a POLICEMAN is seen walking
from behind TRAVIS' taxi to his window.
The POLICEMAN's voice come during a pause in the narration.
LIVE SOUND RESUMES.
POLICEMAN
(standing near window)
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.
(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
(penitent)
Sorry, officer.
POLICEMAN
You waiting for a fare?
POLICEMAN leans his head in window, inspecting the cab. As
he does, TRAVIS slides his right hand into the left side of
his jacket, ready to draw his revolver.
TRAVIS
No, officer.
POLICEMAN
All right, move it.
TRAVIS starts up his taxi and drives off.
LIVE SOUND again CEASES as TRAVIS resumes reading letter as
taxi drives away.
As TRAVIS reads final paragraph, scene CUTS TO INT. APARTMENT
where TRAVIS sits at his table.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
(resuming reading)
I hope this card finds you all well,
as it does me. I hope no one has
died. Don't worry about me.
One day there will be a knock on the
door and it will be me.
Love, Travis.
TRAVIS, at his desk, examines the card upon which he has
just written this letter.
C.U. cover of card. It is a 25¢ Wedding Anniversary card
with a four-color embossed cover. The design could only be
described as ur-kitsch. A cartoon Mr. and Mrs. All-America
stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill, clicking salt and
pepper shakers in a toast. Sentiment reads:
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
To a Couple Who Have Found the Perfect
Combination For Marriage...
THE CARD OPENS TO READ:
LOVE!
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
Underneath the word "Love!" begins TRAVIS' short message to
his parents, a message which extends to the back cover of
the card.
CUT TO:
NIGHT on the LOWER EAST SIDE. TRAVIS sits parked in the
dark shadows of a side street. The lone wolf waits.
TRAVIS watches the SLUM GODDESSES as they work the section
of the street reserved for hippie hookers.
TRAVIS' P.O.V.: SOME OF THE YOUNG STREET GIRLS ARE ARROGANT,
almost aggressive, others are more insecure and inexperienced.
A BLACK MAN charges down the sidewalk across the street from
TRAVIS. He walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only at
the sidewalk in front of him. Out of his mouth comes a
continuous stream of invective: "That-cock-sucking-crazy-nogood-asshole-bitch-when-I-get-my-fucking-fingers-on-hernigger-tits-I'm-gonna-ring-em-and-shit-up-her-ass..." and so
on. He is Out of Control. Nobody seems to notice or care.
TRAVIS takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stakeout.
Finally, TRAVIS spies the object of his search: IRIS walks
down the sidewalk with her GIRLFRIEND. Iris wears her large
blue sunglasses.
TRAVIS checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), opens
the door and exits from the cab.
Flipping up the collar of his Army jacket, TRAVIS slouches
over and walks toward IRIS. He sort of sidles up next to
her and walks beside her: TRAVIS always looks most suspicious
when he's trying to appear innocent.
TRAVIS
(shy)
Hello.
IRIS
You looking for some action?
TRAVIS
Well...I guess so.
IRIS
(eyeing him)
All right.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
IRIS (CONT'D)
(a beat)
You see that guy over there?
(nods)
His name is Sport. Go talk to him.
I'll wait here.
<char who="trav">Travis'</char> eyes follow Iris' nod until they reach Sport, standing
in a doorway in his lime green jacket. <char who="trav">Travis</char> walks toward
him.
Sport, a thirtiesh white greaser, has the affections of a
black pimp. His hips are jiving, his fingers softly snapping.
He sings to him self, "Going to the chapel, gonna get
married..." His complexion is sallow; his eyes cold and venal.
He could only seem romantic to a confused underaged runaway.
TRAVIS
You name Sport?
Sport immediately takes <char who="trav">Travis</char> for an undercover cop. He
extends his crosses wrists as if to be handcuffed.
SPORT
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean.
I didn't do it. Got a ticket once
in Jersey. That's all.
Honest, officer.
TRAVIS
Your name Sport?
SPORT
Anything you say, officer.
TRAVIS
I'm no cop.
(looks back at Iris)
I want some action.
SPORT
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30
half hour.
TRAVIS
Shit.
SPORT
Take it or leave it.
TRAVIS digs in his pocket for money.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
SPORT
No, not me. There'll be an elderly
gent to take the bread.
TRAVIS turns to walk away.
SPORT
Catch you later, Copper.
TRAVIS freezes, not saying anything. He turns back toward
SPORT.
TRAVIS
I'm no cop.
SPORT
Well, if you are, it's entrapment
already.
TRAVIS
I'm hip.
SPORT
Funny, you don't look hip.
(laughs)
TRAVIS walks back to IRIS.
IRIS motions for TRAVIS to follow her and he does.
IRIS and TRAVIS turn the corner and walk about a block, saying
nothing. IRIS turns into a darkened doorway and TRAVIS
follows her.
At the top of the dark stairs IRIS and TRAVIS enter a dimly
lit hallway. On either side are doors with apartment numbers.
IRIS turns toward the first door, No. 2.
IRIS
This is my room.
At the far end of the darkened corridor sits a huge OLD MAN.
His face is obscured by shadow. TRAVIS is about to enter
the room when the OLD MAN speaks up:
OLD MAN
Hey cowboy!
TRAVIS turns his head toward the OLD MAN who has stood up
and is advancing toward him.
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:
OLD MAN
(motioning to TRAVIS'
jacket)
The rod.
(a beat)
Gimme the rod, cowboy.
TRAVIS hesitates a moment, uncertain what to do. The OLD
MAN reaches in TRAVIS' jacket and pulls out the .38 Special.
OLD MAN
This ain't Dodge City, cowboy. You
don't need no piece.
(glances at watch)
I'm keepin' time.
TRAVIS enters No. 2 with IRIS.
TRAVIS looks around IRIS' room: although dimly lit, the room
is brightly decorated. There is an orange shag carpet, deep
brown walls and an old red velvet sofa. On the walls are
posters of Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan and Peter Fonda. A Neil
Young album is playing on a small phonograph.
This is where IRIS lives: it bears the individual touch of a
young girl.
IRIS lights a cigarette, takes a single puff and places it
in an ashtray on the bedstand.
TRAVIS
Why you hang around with them
greasers?
IRIS
A girl needs protection.
TRAVIS
Yeah. From the likes of them.
IRIS
(shrugs)
It's your time mister. Fifteen
minutes ain't long.
(gestures to cigarette)
That cigarette burns out, your time
is up.
IRIS sits on the edge of the bed and removes her hat and
coat. She takes off her blue-tinted sunglasses--her last
defense. Without the paraphernalia of adulthood, Iris looks
like a little girl she is. About 14, 15.
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
What's your name?
IRIS
Easy.
TRAVIS
That ain't much of a name.
IRIS
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
TRAVIS
What's your real name?
IRIS
I don't like my real name.
TRAVIS
(insistent)
What's your real name?
IRIS
Iris.
TRAVIS
That's a nice name.
IRIS
That's what you think.
IRIS unbuttons her shirt, revealing her small pathetic breasts --
two young doves hiding from a winter wind.
TRAVIS is unnerved by her partial nudity.
TRAVIS
Don't you remember me? Button your
shirt.
IRIS buttons only the bottom button of her shirt.
IRIS
(examining him)
Why? Who are you?
TRAVIS
I drive a taxi. You tried to get
away one night. Remember?
IRIS
No.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
You tried to run away in my taxi but
your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let
you.
IRIS
I don't remember.
TRAVIS
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you
outta here.
(looks toward door)
IRIS
We better make it, or Sport'll get
mad. How do you want to make it?
TRAVIS
(pressured)
I don't want to make it. I came
here to get you out.
IRIS
You want to make it like this?
(goes for his fly)
TRAVIS pushes her hand away. He sits beside her on the edge
of the bed.
TRAVIS
(taking her by the
shoulders)
Can't you listen to me? Don't you
want to get out of here?
IRIS
Why should I want to get out of here?
This is where I live.
TRAVIS
(exasperated)
But you're the one that wanted to
get away. You're the one that came
into my cab.
IRIS
I musta been stoned.
TRAVIS
Do they drug you?
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
IRIS
(reproving)
Oh, come off it, man.
IRIS tries to unzip TRAVIS' fly. This only unnerves TRAVIS
more: sexual contact is something he's never really
confronted.
TRAVIS
Listen...
IRIS
Don't you want to make it?
(a beat)
Can't you make it?
IRIS works on TRAVIS' crotch OFF CAMERA. He bats her hand
away.
TRAVIS
(distraught)
I want to help you.
TRAVIS is getting increasingly panicked, but IRIS only thinks
this is part of his particular thing and tries to overcome
it.
IRIS
(catching on)
You can't make it, can you?
(a beat)
I can help you.
IRIS lowers her head to go down on TRAVIS. TRAVIS, seeing
this, jumps up in panic.
TRAVIS stands several feet from IRIS. His fly is still open,
and the white of his underwear shows through his jeans.
He is starting to come apart.
TRAVIS
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck
it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
IRIS
(confused)
You can do it in my mouth.
TRAVIS
Don't you understand anything?
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
IRIS says nothing. After a moment, TRAVIS again sits on the
bed beside IRIS. She no longer tries to make him.
There is a moment of silence. IRIS puts her arm around his
shoulder.
IRIS
You don't have to make it, mister.
TRAVIS rests a moment, collecting himself. Finally, he says:
TRAVIS
(slowly)
Do you understand why I came here?
IRIS
I think so. I tried to get into
your cab one night, and now you want
to come and take me away.
TRAVIS
Don't you want to go?
IRIS
I can leave anytime I want.
TRAVIS
But that one night?
IRIS
I was stoned. That's why they stopped
me. When I'm not stoned, I got no
place else to go. They just protect
me from myself.
There is a pause. TRAVIS smiles and shrugs apologetically.
TRAVIS looks at Iris' cigarette. It's burning down to the
butt.
TRAVIS
Well, I tried.
IRIS
(compassionate)
I understand, mister. It means
something, really.
TRAVIS
(getting up)
Can I see you again?
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED:
IRIS
That's not hard to do.
TRAVIS
No, I mean really. This is nothing
for a person to do.
IRIS
Sure. All right. We'll have
breakfast. I get up about one
o'clock. Tomorrow.
TRAVIS
(thinking)
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I
got a...
IRIS is interfering with TRAVIS' assassination schedule.
IRIS
Well, you want to or not?
TRAVIS
(deciding)
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here,
then.
TRAVIS turns; IRIS smiles.
TOM
Oh, Iris?
IRIS
Yes?
TOM
My name's Travis.
IRIS
Thank you, Travis.
TRAVIS
So long, Iris.
(a beat)
Sweet Iris.
(smiles)
TRAVIS exits.
TRAVIS closes the door to No. 2 and stands in the corridor
for a moment.
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
The OLD MAN slowly walks from the dark end of the hallway
with TRAVIS' .38 in his hand. OLD MAN stands near TRAVIS,
and checks his watch.
OLD MAN
(holding gun)
I think this is yours, cowboy.
TRAVIS reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out the familiar
crumpled $20 bill. He makes a big show of stuffing the
wrinkled bill into the OLD MAN's hand. The OLD MAN doesn't
understand the significance of it.
TRAVIS
(restrained anger)
Here's the twenty bucks, old man.
You better damn well spend it right.
TRAVIS turns and walks away.
OLD MAN says as TRAVIS walks down stairs:
OLD MAN
Come back anytime you want, cowboy.
But without the rod -- please.
TRAVIS does not respond.
CUT TO:
INT. ST. REGIS SUITE NOON
Palantine, Tom and Palantine's Assistant are seated in
garishly decorated suite.
ASSISTANT
Well, at least it wasn't chicken.
PALANTINE
It wasn't? I thought it was. It
tasted like chicken.
TOM
C'mon, Senator. That was a class
dinner. The St. Regis is a class
joint. That was veal.
PALANTINE
Was it? It sure tasted like chicken
to me.
(a beat)
Lately, everything tastes like chicken
to me.
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
ASSISTANT
Everything? Got to watch your gut.
PALANTINE
What about it? I took 20 off before
we started this thing.
ASSISTANT
And you've put ten of it back on.
PALANTINE
Ten? I don't think so. You really
think so? Ten?
TOM
Those TV cameras do. I caught the
rally on CBS. You looked a little
paunchy.
PALANTINE
I don't think I gained ten pounds.
Palantine gets up and walks over to the window. Its bars
form a cross-sight on his head. He thinks to himself:
PALANTINE
(weary)
Jesus Christ.
He looks at the crowded traffic on Fifth Avenue eighteen
floors below. It is a mass of yellow.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIFTH AVE NOON
<char who="trav">Travis'</char> cab pulls away from the yellow mass and heads
downtown.
CUT TO:
EXT. DOWNTONE COFFEE SHOP NOON
<char who="trav">Travis'</char> cab is parked near a neighborhood Bickford's.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS and IRIS are having late breakfast at a middle-class
EAST SIDE COFFEE SHOP. It is about 1:30 P.M.
IRIS is dressed more sensibly, wearing jeans and a maroon
sweater. Her face is freshly washed and her hair combed
out.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
Seen this way, IRIS looks no different than any young girl
in the big city. OTHER PATRONS of the coffee shop most likely
assume she is having lunch with her big brother.
They are both having an All-American breakfast: ham and eggs,
large glasses of orange juice, coffee.
Outside here environment, Iris seems the more pathetic. She
seems unsure, schizy, unable to hold a subject for more than
thirty seconds. Her gestures are too broad, her voice too
mannered. We sympathize with <char who="trav">Travis'</char> paternal respect.
This girl is in trouble.
IRIS
... and after that Sport and I just
started hanging out...
TRAVIS
Where is home?
Iris removes her large blue-tinted sunglasses and fishes
through her bag for another pair.
IRIS
I got so many sunglasses. I couldn't
live without my shades, man. I must
have twelve pair of shades.
She finds a pink-tinted pair and puts them on.
TRAVIS
Where?
IRIS
Pittsburgh.
TRAVIS
I ain't ever been there, but it don't
seem like such a bad place.
IRIS
(voice rising)
Why do you want me to go back to my
parents? They hate me. Why do you
think I split? There ain't nothin
there.
TRAVIS
But you can't live like this. It's
hell. Girls should live at home.
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:
IRIS
(playfully)
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
There is a short, quick silence; TRAVIS' eyes retract. He
goes on:
TRAVIS
(ignoring her question)
Young girls are supposed to dress
up, go to school, play with boys,
you know, that kinda stuff.
Iris places a large gob of jam on her unbuttered toast and
folds the bread over like a hotdog.
IRIS
God, you are square.
TRAVIS
(releasing pent-up
tension)
At least I don't walk the streets
like a skunk pussy. I don't screw
and fuck with killers and junkies.
IRIS motions him to lower his voice.
IRIS
Who's a killer?
TRAVIS
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer
to me.
IRIS
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
TRAVIS
Huh?
IRIS
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get
along so well.
TRAVIS
He looks like a killer.
IRIS
I think Cancer's make the best lovers.
My whole family are air signs.
(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
He shoots dope too.
IRIS
What makes you so high and mighty?
Did you ever look at your own eyeballs
in a mirror. You don't get eyes
like that from...
TRAVIS
He's worse than an animal. Jail's
too good for scum like that.
There is a brief silence. Iris mind continued to whirl at
78 rpms. She seems to have three subjects on her mind at a
time. She welcomes this opportunity to unburden herself.
IRIS
Rock music died in 1970, that's what
I think. Before that it was
fantastic. I can tell you that.
Everybody was crashing, hanging out
at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend
Ann used to go up the fire escape,
you know? It was unbelievable.
Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane--
that's my group, man. All Libras.
But now everybody's split or got
sick or busted. I think I'll move
to one of those communes in Vermont,
you know? That's where all the smart
ones went. I stayed here.
TRAVIS
I never been to a commune. I don't
know. I saw pictures in a magazine,
and it didn't look very clean to me.
IRIS
Why don't you come to a commune with
me?
TRAVIS
Me? I could never go to a place
like that.
IRIS
Why not?
TRAVIS
(hesitant)
I... I don't get along with people
like that.
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
IRIS
You a scorpion? That's it. You're
a scorpion. I can tell.
TRAVIS
Besides, I've got to stay here.
IRIS
Why?
TRAVIS
I've got something important to do.
I can't leave.
IRIS
What's so important?
TRAVIS
I can't say -- it's top secret.
I'm doing something for the Army.
The cab thing is just part time.
IRIS
You a narc?
TRAVIS
Do I look like a narc?
IRIS
Yeah.
TRAVIS breaks out in his big infectious grin, and IRIS joins
his laughter.
IRIS
God, I don't know who's weirder, you
or me.
TRAVIS
(pause)
What are you going to do about Sport
and that old bastard?
IRIS
Just leave'em. There's plenty of
other girls.
TRAVIS
You just gonna leave 'em?
IRIS
(astonished)
What should I do? Call the cops?
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
Cops don't do nothin.
IRIS
Sport never treated me bad, honest.
Never beat me up once.
TRAVIS
You can't leave 'em to do the same
to other girls. You should get rid
of them.
IRIS
How?
TRAVIS
(shrugs)
I don't know. Just should, though.
(a beat)
Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd
miss 'em.
IRIS
(taken back)
God. I know where they should have
a commune for you. They should have
a commune for you at Bellevue.
TRAVIS
(apologetic/sheepish)
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
IRIS
You're not much with girls, are you?
TRAVIS
(thinks)
Well, Iris, I look at it this way.
A lot of girls come into my cab,
some of them very beautiful. And I
figure all day long men have been
after them: trying to touch them,
talk to them, ask them out. And
they hate it. So I figure the best
I can do for them is not bother them
at all. So I don't say a thing. I
pretend I'm not even there. I figure
they'll understand that and appreciate
me for it.
It takes IRIS a moment to digest this pure example of negative
thinking: I am loved to the extent I do not exist.
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
IRIS
Do you really think I should go to
the commune?
TRAVIS
I think you should go home, but
otherwise I think you should go.
It would be great for you. You have
to get away from here. The city's a
sewer, you gotta get out of it.
Mumbling something about her "shades" again, Iris fishes
through her bag until she comes up with another 99¢ pair of
sunglasses and puts them on. She likes these better, she
decides.
IRIS
Sure you don't want to come with me?
TRAVIS
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
IRIS
I sure hate to go alone...
TRAVIS
I'll give you the money to go. I
don't want you to take any from those
guys.
IRIS
You don't have to.
TRAVIS
I want to -- what else can I do with
my money?
(thinks)
You may not see me again--for a while.
IRIS
What do you mean?
CLOSE ON C.U. OF TRAVIS:
TRAVIS
My work may take me out of New York.
CUT TO:
IRIS' ROOM - DAY
Sport stands beside the bed.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
SPORT
What's the matter, baby, don't you
feel right?
Iris is wearing her blue-tinted shades.
IRIS
It's my stomach. I got the flu.
Sport puts his hand on her hips. He is slowly, carefully,
smoothly manipulating her. It's the stone black hustle.
SPORT
Oh, baby, there ain't no flu. You
know that, baby.
IRIS
Honest, Sport.
Sport puts some slow soul music on the stereo.
SPORT
You're just tired, baby. You just
need your man. I am your man, you
know. You are my woman. I wouldn't
be nothing without you.
Sport slowly grinds his hips to hers. Iris starts to move
with him. This is what she really wanted. Her man's
attention.
SPORT
I know this may not mean anything to
you, baby, but sometimes I get so
emotional, sometimes I think, I wish
every man could have what I have
now, that every woman could be loved
the way I love you. I go home and I
think what it would be without you,
and then I thank God for you. I
think to myself, man, you are so
lucky. You got a woman who loves
you, who needs you, a woman who keeps
you strong. It's just you and me.
I'm nothing without you. I can go
like this for ever and ever. We can
do it, baby. You and me. Just you
and me.
Sport slowly rubs his crotch into her. Iris smiles. She is
happy. The music rises.
CUT TO:
100.
FIRING RANGE - DAY
TRAVIS stands at the firing range blasting the .44 Magnum
with a rapid-fire vengeance.
He sets down one gun, picks up the next, then the next.
Quickly reloading, he fires again.
The targets spin and dance under his barrage. The piercing
sound of GUNSHOTS ring through the air.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT
TRAVIS is again writing at the table. His western shirt is
open, exposing his bare chest.
A note of despair and doom has entered into TRAVIS' normally
monotone narration voice: this will be the last entry in his
diary.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
My whole life has pointed in one
direction. I see that now. There
never has been any choice for me.
CUT TO:
LENGTHY P.O.V. SHOT from TRAVIS' taxi: we see New York's
nightlife as TRAVIS sees it. CAMERA TRACKS down midtown
sidewalks in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION. There we see:
COUPLES, walking in SLOWING MOTION, young couples, middleaged couples, old couples, hookers and johns, girlfriends,
boyfriends, business friends -- the whole world matched up
in pairs, and TRAVIS left wandering alone in the night.
Others would notice the breasts, the asses, the faces, but
not TRAVIS: he notices the girl's hand that rubs the hair on
her boyfriend's neck, the hand that hangs lightly on his
shoulder, the nuzzling kiss in the ear.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Loneliness has followed me all my
life. The life of loneliness pursues
me wherever I go: in bars, cars,
coffee shops, theaters, stores,
sidewalks. There is no escape. I
am God's lonely man.
MATCHCUT TO P.O.V.: another neighborhood, LATER IN THE NIGHT.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
Still in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.
The CROWDS are more sparse here, the streets darker. A JUNKIE
shudders in a doorway, a WINO pukes into a trash can, a STREETWALKER meets a prospective CLIENT.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I am not a fool. I will no longer
fool myself. I will no longer let
myself fall apart, become a joke and
object of ridicule. I know there is
no longer any hope. I cannot continue
this hollow, empty fight. I must
sleep. What hope is there for me?
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT
TRAVIS, his shirt fastened, stands beside table.
C.U.: He lays a brief hand-written letter on the table. We
read it.
TRAVIS
Dear Iris, This money should be enough
for your trip. By the time you read
this I will be dead.
TRAVIS stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the
letter, folds them up with the letter, and puts them into an
envelope.
TIMECUT: A SHORT WHILE LATER. TRAVIS has cleaned up his
apartment. Everything is neat and orderly.
CAMERA PANS across room. The mattress is bare and flattened
out, the floor is spotless, the cans and bottles of food and
pills put out of sight. The wall is still covered with
Palantine political paraphernalia, but when we reach the
desk we see only four items there: an open diary and three
loaded revolvers: .44, .38, .25.
TRAVIS, freshly shaved and neatly dressed, stands in the
middle of his clean room. The empty holster hangs on his
shoulder. Metal .25 gliders can be seen under the slit in
his right sleeve. He turns toward table.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS, envelope in hand, closes the door behind him and
walks down the corridor.
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
He passes a ajar door and we are suprised to see the room is
empty--and trashed. <char who="trav">Travis</char> lives in a decaying, if not
condemned building.
EXT.
TRAVIS places the envelope to IRIS in his mail box.
BACK IN APARTMENT. CAMERA CLOSE ON revolvers lying on the
table in neat array.
CUT TO:
FADE IN:
SOUND of a political rally: cheering, laughing, a band
playing, talking.
AFTERNOON. A CROWD of about 500 PERSONS is assembled before
a platform outside a Brooklyn union hall. A DIXIELAND BAND
is playing on the platform.
C.U. CHARLES PALANTINE's feet climb out of a limousine.
There is a ROAR from the nearby CROWD.
PALANTINE, a bulky SECRET SERVICE MAN to the right and left
of him, pushes his way through the CROWD toward the platform.
Still cameras click, and TV cameras purr.
SLIGHT TIMECUT: PALANTINE is speaking on the platform.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS' empty taxi sits parked a few blocks away from rally.
At this distance, the rally sounds are almost
indistinguishable.
C.U. of TRAVIS' boots walking. They make their way past one
person, then two, then a cluster of three or four. SOUNDS
of rally increase.
We see a FULL FIGURE SHOT of TRAVIS: he is standing alone in
an opening near the fringes of the CROWD.
TRAVIS looks like the most suspicious human being alive.
His hair is cropped short, he wears mirror-reflecting glasses.
His face is pallid and drained of color, his lips are pursed
and drawn tight. He looks from side to side.
(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:
One can now see the full effect of TRAVIS' lack of sleep and
sufficient diet -- he looks sick and frail.
Even though it is a warm June day, TRAVIS is bundled up in a
shirt, sweater and Army jacket buttoned from top to bottom.
Under his jacket are several large lumps, causing his upper
torso to look larger than it should. He is slightly hunched
over and his hands shoved into his pockets.
Anyone scanning the crowd would immediately light upon TRAVIS
and think, "There is an assassin."
TRAVIS pulls the vial of red pills from his pocket and
swallows a couple.
CUT TO:
SECRET SERVICE MAN standing beside the platform, scanning
the CROWD. It is the same SECRET SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke
to at the first rally. TOM, dressed in a conservative suit,
stands beside him.
PALANTINE is wrapping up his short speech:
PALANTINE
... and with your help we will go on
to victry at the polls Tuesday.
(applause)
TRAVIS begins moving up into the crowd.
PALANTINE
On to victory in Miami Beach next
month
(building applause)
and on to victory next November!
PALANTINE steps back, smiling and receiving the applause.
Then, nodding, at the SECRET SERVICE MAN he descends the
stairs and prepares to work his way through the CROWD.
TRAVIS unbuttons the middle two buttons of his jacket, opening
access to his holster. With the other hand he checks the
.44 hooked behind his back.
PALANTINE smiles and shakes a few of the many hands
outstretched toward him.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN, scanning the CROWD, spots something
that interests him. He looks closely.
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
SECRET SERVICE MAN'S P.O.V.: TRAVIS, his face intense, pushes
his way through the CROWD.
PALANTINE works his way through crowds and cameras.
SECRET SERVICE MAN motions to SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN and
points in TRAVIS' direction.
TRAVIS slips his hand into his jacket.
The SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN converges on TRAVIS from the
side.
TRAVIS and PALANTINE draw closer to each other.
SECRET SERVICE MAN, walking just behind PALANTINE, grabs the
candidate's hand and pulls him backward. PALANTINE looks
sharply back at SECRET SERVICE MAN who motions for him to
take a slightly altered route.
TRAVIS sees this: his eyes meet the SECRET SERVICE MAN's.
He recognizes the situation. To his right he spots the
SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN.
TRAVIS' eyes meet PALANTINE's: candidate and would-be assassin
exchange quick glances.
TRAVIS hastily works his way back through the CROWD. He
hears the SECRET SERVICE MAN's voice call out:
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Detain that man!
OVERHEAD SHOT reveals TRAVIS has the jump on his pursuers.
He is breaking free of the CROWD while they are still mired
in it.
TRAVIS, free of his pursuers, quickly makes his way down the
sidewalks. The SECRET SERVICE MEN look futilely about.
TRAVIS jumps in his cab. Sweat covers his face.
CUT TO:
The film is moving fast now; it pushes hard and straight
toward its conclusion. We're moving toward the kill.
LATE AFTERNOON. TRAVIS' taxi skids around a corner and speeds
into Manhattan.
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS checks his mail slot: the letter to IRIS has already
been picked up by the MAILMAN.
TRAVIS, stripped to the waist, walks back and forth across
his INT. APARTMENT, wiping his torso with a bath towel.
TRAVIS BEGINS DRESSING:
-- He straps the Army combat knife to his calf.
-- He reflexes the metal gliders and the Colt .25 on his
right forearm.
INTERCUT: SPORT stands in his doorway on the LOWER EAST SIDE
shot with LONG DISTANCE LENS. It is EARLY EVENING.
INTERCUT: A pudgy middle-aged white PRIVATE COP walks up to
SPORT. The two men laugh, slap each other on the back and
exchange a soul shake. They discuss a little private business
and the PRIVATE COP walks off in the direction of IRIS'
apartment.
-- TRAVIS straps on holster and fits the .38 Special into
it.
INTERCUT: PRIVATE COP walks down block.
-- TRAVIS hooks the huge Magnum into the back of his belt.
He puts on his Army jacket and walks out the door.
INTERCUT: PRIVATE COP turns up darkened stairway to IRIS'
apartment.
NIGHT has fallen: TRAVIS' taxi careens down 10th Ave. He
speeds, honks, accelerates quickly. The glare of speeding
yellow and red lights flash through the night.
TRAVIS' P.O.V.: PEDESTRIAN attempts to flag down TRAVIS'
taxi, but quickly steps back up on the curb when he sees
TRAVIS has no intention of stopping for anything.
INTERCUT: SPORT maintains his post in the dark doorway. He
waves to a GIRL who passes, and she waves back.
TRAVIS' taxi screeches to a stop and parks obliquely against
the curb.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS walks down the block to the doorway where SPORT stands.
CAMERA TRACKS with TRAVIS.
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
Without slowing, TRAVIS walks up to SPORT and puts his arm
on his shoulder in a gesture of friendliness.
TRAVIS
Hey, Sport. How are things?
SPORT
(shrugs)
O.K., cowboy.
TRAVIS
(needling him)
How are things in the pimp business,
hey Sport?
SPORT
What's going on?
TRAVIS
I'm here to see Iris.
SPORT
Iris?
TRAVIS pushes SPORT back into the dark recesses of the
corridor.
SPORT
Wha -- ?
TRAVIS
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by
that name?
SPORT
No.
(beat)
Hillbilly, you'd better get your
wise ass outa here and quick, or
you're gonna be in trouble.
TRAVIS is being propelled by an inner force, a force which
takes him past the boundaries of reason and self-control.
TRAVIS
(restrained anger)
You carry a gun?
SPORT looks into TRAVIS' eyes, saying nothing: he realizes
the seriousness of the situation.
TRAVIS pulls his .38 Special and holds it on SPORT, pushing
him even further back against the wall.
(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
Get it.
SPORT
(submissive)
Hey, mister, I don't know what's
going on here. This don't make any
sense.
TRAVIS
(demanding)
Show it to me.
SPORT reluctantly pulls a .32 caliber pistol (a "purse gun")
from his pocket and holds it limply.
TRAVIS sticks his .38 into SPORT's gut and discharges it.
There is a muffled blast, followed by a muted scream of pain.
TRAVIS
Now suck on that.
Agony and shock cross SPORT'S face as he slumps to the floor.
TRAVIS turns and walks away before SPORT even hits.
As TRAVIS walks away, SPORT can be seen struggling in the
b.g.
TRAVIS, he gun slipped into his jacket, walks quickly up the
sidewalk.
AROUND THE CORNER, TRAVIS walks into the darkened stairway
leading to IRIS' apartment.
As he walks up the stairs, TRAVIS pulls the .44 Magnum from
behind his back and transfers the .38 Special to his left
hand. He walks up the steps, a pistol dangling from each
hand.
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, TRAVIS spots THE OLD MAN sitting
at the far end of the dark corridor. THE OLD MAN starts to
get up when TRAVIS discharges the mighty .44 at him. BLAAM!
The hallway reverberates with shock waves and gun powder.
THE OLD MAN staggers at the end of the corridor: his right
hand has been blown off at the forearm.
There is the sharp SOUND of a GUNSHOT behind TRAVIS: his
face grimaces in pain. A bullet has ripped through the left
side of his neck. Blood flows over his left shoulder.
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS' .44 flies into the air.
TRAVIS looks down the stairway: there SPORT lies choking in
a puddle of his own blood. He has struggled long enough to
fire one shot.
Falling, TRAVIS drills another .38 slug into SPORT's back
but SPORT is already dead.
TRAVIS slumps to his knees. Down the corridor THE OLD MAN
with a bloody stump is struggling toward him. TRAVIS turns
his .38 toward THE OLD MAN.
The door to No. 2 opens: IRIS' scream is heard in the b.g.
The bulky frame of the PRIVATE COP fills the doorway. His
blue shirt is open, in his hand hangs a .38 service revolver.
The PRIVATE COP raises his gun and shoots TRAVIS. TRAVIS,
blood gushing from his right shoulder, sinks to the floor.
His .38 clangs down the stairs.
THE OLD MAN grows closer. TRAVIS smashes his right arm
against the wall, miraculously, the small Colt .25 glides
down his forearm into his palm.
TRAVIS fills the PRIVATE COP's face full of bullet holes.
The PRIVATE COP, SCREAMING, crashes back into the room.
THE OLD MAN crashes atop TRAVIS. The .25 falls from TRAVIS'
hand.
Both men are bleeding profusely as they thrash into IRIS'
room. IRIS hides behind the old red velvet sofa, her face
frozen in fright.
TRAVIS, trapped under the heavy OLD MAN, reaches down with
his right hand and pulls the combat knife from his right
calf.
Just as TRAVIS draws back the knife, THE OLD MAN brings his
huge left palm crashing down on TRAVIS: THE OLD MAN's palm
is impaled on the knife.
OLD MAN SCREAMS in pain.
Police SIRENS are heard in b.g.
With great effort, TRAVIS turns over, pinning THE OLD MAN to
the floor. The bloody knife blade sticks through his upturned
hand.
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS reaches over with his right hand and picks up the
revolver of the new dead PRIVATE COP.
TRAVIS hoists himself up and sticks the revolver into the
OLD MAN's mouth.
THE OLD MAN's voice is full of pain and ghastly fright:
OLD MAN
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!
IRIS screams in b.g. TRAVIS looks up:
IRIS
Don't kill him, Travis! Don't kill
him!
TRAVIS fires the revolver, blowing the back of THE OLD MAN's
head off the silencing his protests.
The police SIRENS screech to a halt. SOUND of police officers
running up the stairs.
TRAVIS struggles up and collapses on the red velvet sofa,
his blood-soaked body blending with the velvet.
IRIS retreats in fright against the far wall.
First uniformed POLICE OFFICER rushes in room, drawn gun in
hand. Other POLICEMEN can be heard running up the stairs.
TRAVIS looks helplessly up at the OFFICER. He forms his
bloody hand into a pistol, raises it to his forehead and,
his voice croaking in pain, makes the sound of a pistol
discharging.
TRAVIS
Pgghew! Pgghew!
Out of breath fellow OFFICERS join the first POLICEMAN.
They survey the room.
TRAVIS' head slumps against the sofa.
IRIS is huddled in the corner, shaking.
LIVE SOUND CEASES.
OVERHEAD SLOW MOTION TRACKING SHOT surveys the damage:
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
-- from IRIS shaking against the blood-spattered wall -- to
TRAVIS blood-soaked body lying on the sofa -- to THE OLD MAN
with half a head, a bloody stump for one
hand and a knife sticking out the other
-- to POLICE OFFICERS staring in amazement -- to the PRIVATE
COP's bullet-ridden face trapped near the
DOORWAY
-- to puddles of blood and a lonely .44 Magnum lying on the
hallway carpet.
Down the blood-specked stairs on which lies a nickel- plated
.38 Smith and Wesson Special
-- to the foot of the stairs where SPORT's body is hunched
over a pool of blood and a small .32 lies near his hand
-- to CROWDS huddled around the doorway, held back by POLICE
OFFICERS
-- past red flashing lights, running POLICEMEN and parked
POLICE CARS
-- to the ongoing nightlife of the Lower East Side, curious
but basically unconcerned, looking then heading its own way.

EXT. TRAVIS' APARTMENT - DAY
It is EARLY FALL. The trees are losing their leaves.
CUT TO:
SLOW TRACKING SHOT across INT. APARTMENT. Room appears pretty
much the same, although there is a new portable TV and an
inexpensive easy chair.
VISUAL: TRACK begins at table and works across the room to
the mattress.
WE SEE THESE ITEMS:
-- On the table rests the diary, closed. A desk calendar
stands on the table: it is October.
-- Across the wall where the Palantine clippings once hung
(CONTINUED)
111.
CONTINUED:
there are now a series of new newspaper clippings. Right to
left, they read:
1. The first is a full back page from the N.Y. Daily News.
Headline reads: "CABBIE BATTLES GANGSTERS." There are large
photos of police standing in IRIS' room after the slaughter,
and a picture of TRAVIS' cabbie mug shot.
2. Underneath there is a more discreet clipping without photo
from the N.Y. Times. Two-column headline reads:
"Cabbie Shootout, Three Dead."
3. A follow-up story from the News. Two-column photo shows
plain middle-aged couple sitting in middle-class living room.
Two-column headline reads: "Parents Express Shock, Gratitude."
4. A two-column Daily News story without photo. Headline
reads: "Taxi-Driver Hero to Recover."
5. A one-column two-paragraph News story stuck on an obscure
page. Headline reads: "Cabbie Returns to Job."
-- At the end of the clippings, a letter is tacked to the
wall. It is a simple letter hand-written on plain white
paper. The handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear
neat and orderly. We recognize that it is the same letter
that is being read in voice over.
-- When we finally arrive at the mattress, we find it is
barren. A pillow and blanket (new purchases) are folded at
the head of the mattress.
AUDIO: THROUGHOUT THE TRACK, we hear the voice of a middleaged uneducated man reading in voice over.
It is the voice of IRIS' FATHER and he is reading a letter
he sent to TRAVIS, and which TRAVIS has tacked to his wall.
IRIS' FATHER (V.O.)
Dear Mr. Bickle, I can't say how
happy Mrs. Steensma and I were to
hear that you are well and
recuperating. We tried to visit you
at the hospital when we were in New
York to pick up Iris, but you were
still in a coma. There is no way we
can repay you for returning our Iris
to us. We thought we had lost her,
but now our lives are full again.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:
IRIS' FATHER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Needless to say, you are something
of a hero around this household.
I'm sure you want to know about Iris.
She is back in school and working
hard. The transition has been very
hard for her, as you can well imagine,
but we have taken steps to see she
never has cause to run away again.
In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you from
the bottom of our hearts.
Unfortunately, we cannot afford to
come to New York again to thank you
in person, or we surely would. But
if you should ever come to Pittsburgh,
you would find yourself a most welcome
guest in our home. Our deepest
thanks, Burt and Ivy Steensma
CUT TO:
EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT
Four cabs stand in the waiting line in front of the hotel.
Near the entrance, TRAVIS and WIZARD stand in the light
talking.
TRAVIS' hair is almost fully grown back to its normal length.
TRAVIS wears the same clothes -- cowboy boots, jeans, western
shirt, Army jacket -- but he isn't wearing a gun.
There is a thick scar on the left side of his neck.
Wizard is speaking.
WIZARD
A private-owner wanted to swap wheels.
Now my tires were brand new. "Give
me a couple days," I says.
CHARLIE T. parks his cab in line and walks toward TRAVIS and
WIZARD.
CHARLIE T
Howdy Wizard, Killer.
CHARLIE T. points his pistol/finger at TRAVIS, fires, says
"Pow" and laughs.

113.
CONTINUED:
CHARLIE T (CONTD)
(casual joking)
Don't mess with the Killer.
TRAVIS
(smiles)
Hey Charlie T.
WIZARD
Howsit, Charlie?
(pause)
Hey Travis, I think you gota fare.
They all turn. P.O.V. of DOORMAN closing rear door of TRAVIS'
taxi.
TRAVIS
Shit.
(runs off)
CHARLIE T
Take it slow, Killer.
TRAVIS waves back to CHARLIE T. and WIZARD as he runs around
cab and jumps in the driver's seat.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls away.
C.U. TRAVIS at the wheel. A FEMALE VOICE says:
FEMALE VOICE
34 East 56th Street.
TRAVIS recognizes the voice. He looks in the rear-view
mirror: It is BETSY.
TRAVIS says nothing: he heads toward 56th Street.
AFTER A SILENCE, BETSY SPEAKS:
BETSY
Hello, Travis.
TRAVIS
Hello, Betsy.
There is an uneasy pause.
TRAVIS
I see where Palantine got the
nomination.
(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED:
BETSY
Yes. It won't be long now.
Seventeen days.
TRAVIS
Well, I hope he wins.
There is another pause.
BETSY
(concerned)
How are you, Travis? I read about
you in the papers.
TRAVIS
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing,
really. The papers always blow these
things up.
(a beat)
A little stiffness. That'll go away.
I just sleep more, that's all.
EXT.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls up to 34 East 56th Street.
TRAVIS
Here we are.
BETSY digs in her purse.
TRAVIS
(protesting)
No, no, please. This fare's on me.
Please.
BETSY
Thank you, Travis.
BETSY gets out of the cab and stands by the right front
window, which is open.
TRAVIS prepares to drive away.
BETSY
Travis?
TRAVIS
Yeah.
BETSY
Maybe I'll see you again sometime,
huh?
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
TRAVIS
(thin smile)
Sure.
BETSY steps away from the curb and TRAVIS drives off. She
watches his taxi.
